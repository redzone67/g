Tom, thanks so much for joining me. It's great to have you back on the program. 
BARKIN
Glad to be here.

This week, we got new readings on consumer and producer prices that did not show progress towards your 2% inflation target. The consumer price index holding steady on a core basis at 3.3%, the same level since September, up a tick from this summer. Producer prices also similarly warmer. Fitcher Powell says he now expects an uptick in your core. PCE preferred inflation gauge for the month of October. Does the stickiness of core inflation signal that inflation risks getting stuck above your target? 
BARKIN
Thanks. So maybe I'll talk about the data and then also what I'm hearing in the marketplace. On the data side, I've always expected that the last half of this year, core inflation would stay flat somewhere in the high twos on a PCE basis. 
And the reason for that is that the reads last year were so good in the second half of the year that the comps were just very difficult. And so the numbers are coming in. They're about where we expected. We may get some good news in the first quarter of the year because you'll remember the first quarter was not very good from an inflation standpoint. I am still seeing progress. And where I'm seeing it most is when I talk to people. 
And the way I'd put it is this. Consumers have been frustrated by high prices for a while, but they're finally acting on it. They're buying on promotion. They're trading down. They're going to lower price outlets. You can look at earnings reports of the everyday low price guys, and you can see it. Consumers are making choices, and those choices are sending messages to price setters that their pricing power has just gotten limited. 
And so I'm seeing that roll out as I test with businesses what they're planning for the first quarter in terms of price increases. I'm not hearing the kind of inflation we've seen in the past. And that gives me hope that as we get through the first quarter, those numbers will come down. So it sounds like going into next year.
M
You do expect inflation to come down from this sort of sticky core level that we've been seeing right now? 
BARKIN
It's my expectation, and it's my hope. Trust, but verify. Of course. President-elect Donald Trump has pledged across the board tariffs 10% on all US imports, 60% on all Chinese imports. 
M
Do you see tariffs as a one-time reset in prices, or could there be ongoing longer-term inflationary effects that would cause you to rethink the battle with inflation? 
BARKIN
We have a researcher on my team who wrote a great article on electoral uncertainty saying, you think election uncertainty is about the candidate, but it's actually more about what's the agenda actually going to be as opposed to what people have talked about, and then how much of it gets implemented. And I think we're a long way away from knowing what we're going to have in tariffs, how big they're going to be, whether we have retaliation or not. 
And so it's awfully hard to know what the impact is on inflation. Obviously, if you increase the cost of goods coming into the country, that cost will, at least in some part, get passed on. But a lot depends on what we've got, how long it lasts, what the behaviors are on the backside. And it's just hard to make a call on that. 
M
How are you viewing the strength in the job market now? 
BARKIN
Hiring level's down to 2014 levels. People are managing headcount down largely through attrition. But they're also still being very cautious on letting people off. You saw initial claims yesterday, still very low. And so it's a low-hiring, low-firing environment. That doesn't feel to me like a long-term equilibrium. 
It feels to me like either people are going to end up trusting demand, finding that they're short-staffed, and hiring again, or feeling the margins compressed and starting to lay people off. In my conversations, that's why I then push on, are you planning layoffs? And I have to say, you're just not hearing it at any scale. And you know well it takes time to plan a layoff. 
M
So given your sentiments on inflation and the job market, how restrictive do you think you are right now? 
BARKIN
I think we're restrictive enough. The whole notion of what the neutral rate is is one of these unobservable variables that people look for in the forest and can never find. And so I think you have to sort of see how restrictive you are by what's happening in the economy. 
M
Do you think inflation's coming down? 
BARKIN
That's a sign we're restrictive. It's just hard to know whether we're somewhat restrictive, a little bit restrictive, very restrictive. And you've seen in the SEP the broad range of estimates of me and my colleagues. We'll just have to figure it out as we go. 
M
Yeah, I guess to follow up on that, I mean, how restrictive do you think you need to be in this environment and going forward, given your outlook? 
BARKIN
Well, I'd like to get inflation sustainably down to 2%. That's the core of being restrictive. I don't think we have to be as restrictive as we were three or four months ago. That's why I voted for the last two rate decreases because I think we can recalibrate rates to a somewhat less restrictive level and still have the impact we wanna have on inflation while having somewhat less impact on demand. 
M
What would cause you not to cut rates in December? 
BARKIN
There's so much that's gonna happen between now and then. I let the data come in. We've got the option value of allowing it to come in, and then we'll have a good discussion and make a call. Treasury yields have backed up some 90 basis points since you first cut rates in September. You've cut rates by a cumulative 75 basis points. 
M
How does that work into your calculus for setting rates, and does that complicate your job? 
BARKIN
Well, I thought you were gonna say, why has the yield curve been inverted for so long, and now it's finally un-inverted, so we'll take that as some good news. Look, rates came down significantly during the summer, I think, in anticipation of what was gonna happen. 
Since we first started cutting rates, I'd say the data's come in, the demand data's certainly come in stronger. There's a lot of conversations going on about what next year might look like, and most people, I think, are moving toward the, hey, the demand might be healthier than I'd otherwise thought, and that's probably got some implication, too. Maybe fiscal's playing a role. Most people don't understand. 
We control the short end of the curve. We don't control the long end of the curve, and there's a lot of factors going on there, and so I think we're doing the right thing on the short end of the curve. I know a lot of people are happy that the yield curve is un-inverted. We'll see what happens over time. As we've shown in the last four or five months, it can move around a lot. 
And to your point, the economy does look like it is remaining strong here. Strong retail sales numbers out today. Consumer spending's solid. You mentioned your sentiments on the job market. You think inflation is gonna continue to come down. 
M
So what does that spell for the pace of rate cuts, given that you do have a strong economy and that demand seems to be strong right now? Does that spell a slower pace for rate cuts going forward? 
BARKIN
I think about it in two phases. There's recalibration, and then there's normalization. Recalibration is what we've been doing, which is to say with inflation as close to target as it's been, with unemployment as close to the natural rate as it's been, the one number that seemed a little out of sync was the Fed funds rate. And so you can afford to bring that down to a somewhat less restrictive level. 
And so that's what we've done in the last couple of meetings. You're gonna have to then turn to normalization. When we start to normalize rates in a world with an uncertain R star and an uncertain forecast for the economy, you probably do wanna be a little bit more careful. 
M
I think President Logan gave a speech I liked yesterday talking about slowing the boat down as you approach the dock. So then you said you think you're fairly restrictive now and you're pointing to slowing down the boat as you approach the dock. There's still room to cut a little bit here though. Is that correct? 
BARKIN
Well, if you look at where we are right now, we're above each member of the FOMC's best estimate of what neutral is at the September meeting. And so that does suggest that every one of us imagines that where we are right now is restrictive, yes. 
M
And so where do you see neutral and how much room there is left to cut at this point? 
BARKIN
Well, we'll see. I think I'm always been at the mindset that trying to pick a number when the models will give you a standard error of 200 basis points either way. And the models vary by 200 basis points themselves as sort of a fool's errand. 
And so I'm more in the world of trying to understand whether I think we see demand flourishing or weakening, whether we see inflation settling or staying stubbornly high and to respond with interest rates based on that information, not on a minute by minute basis or even a month by month basis, but on a medium term basis. I think that's the way you sort of sort your way through neutral. 
And I think that's probably a better way to conduct policy than to try to pick a number, decide that's neutral and go move the boat to that dock. 
M
I wanna ask you about productivity. How are you viewing productivity and the possibility that it could remain strong as you look at a strong economy, perhaps stick your core inflation at the moment, the job market and the sentiments you shared on that and how that would factor in to the pace of rate cuts? 
BARKIN
Well, really gratified by how strong productivity has been over the last couple of years. Obviously that's helped us keep wage inflation, unit costs down and that also helps the economy grow. So it's been a huge help. We'll see how long it lasts. 
I do believe a lot of today's activity, everyone wants to talk about AI and maybe that'll help in time. But I think a big part of what's happening here is the aftermath of the experience of two years ago. Companies were short workers, they needed to do something. And so people invested in automation, they redesigned their processes. And what we're seeing now in productivity, I think is the outgrowth of the investments made a couple of years ago. 
Now, I believe those investments can and will continue because I think we are likely to be short labor for not just a year or two, but for 10 or 20, given demographics and fertility and all the rest of that. And so I do think there's incentive for businesses to continue to be investing in productivity. Then you can see that on the backend. So I'm encouraged by it, I'm hopeful we'll see more. 
I attribute it much more to specific target initiatives taken in the context of shortage than I do to, some mega galactic thought like artificial intelligence. So that may help us in time. Speaking, we were talking about the treasury market. 
M
I'm curious if there's so much volatility in the treasury market, would that cause you to stop your balance sheet runoff? 
BARKIN
Well, we made significant investments in the balance sheet during the COVID era. We've committed to try to normalize as best we can. We are looking for signals. The desk has been very clear about some of the ones we look at that would suggest that we hit the time where we go from abundant to ample reserves. And we're not really seeing those signals yet. Who knows when they'll show up. I don't think the treasury rate though is one of those signals. I think it's more about the functioning of the markets. 
M
If President Trump, I should say President-elect Trump were to pressure the Fed to lower rates, but the Fed did not feel that that was the appropriate course of action, how would the Fed respond to that? 
BARKIN
We run a committee that I think the American public would be proud of. You've got 19 independent people, very thoughtful, independent research staffs trying their best to do the right thing for the American people. And then have a conversation where we put all of our best thinking on the table and wrestle with the issues and try to come up with the best answer. And that's what we've been doing through my seven years on the committee. And that's what I anticipate continuing to do. 
M
Thank you so much for your insight. So appreciate it. Hope to speak with you again soon.
