House Financial Services Committee Holds Hearing on Monetary Policy Report
LIST OF PANEL MEMBERS AND WITNESSES

PATRICK MCHENRY:
Committee will come to order. Without objection, the chair is authorized to declare a recess of the committee at any time. The hearing is titled the Federal Reserve's Semiannual Monetary Policy Report. We'd like creative titles here, and that is our traditional title for Humphrey Hawkins. Without objection, all members will have five legislative days within which to submit extraneous material to the chair for inclusion in the record.

I'll note at the outset this hearing has a hard stop at 1:00 PM, which we will strictly observe, which seems only humane. I'll now recognize myself for four minutes for an opening statement. Thank you, Chair Powell, for being back with us today. With price -- with prices increasing more than 20 percent since President Biden took office, inflation remains top of mind for American families.

In fact, only a quarter of Americans describe current economic conditions as good or excellent, according to the most recent data from Gallup's Economic Confidence Index. Despite President Biden's gaslighting, inflation was not 9 percent when he took office. It was out of control -- the out of control inflation we're experiencing now is something that this administration did not inherit, but it is a product of their policies and their overspending.

The nearly $2 trillion partisan and fiscally reckless spending as a part of the American Rescue Plan poured fuel on a smoldering inflationary fire. After a delayed response to runaway inflation, the FOMC has acted with a historic pace of interest rate hikes to ease the pain caused by Democrats' failed economic policies.

It is a response, not the actual disease, but the response. The Fed is trying to tame these flames, but it's a response to Democrat policies here on Capitol Hill and the administration. So far this year, inflation has been more persistent than many, including the Fed, previously expected. There's still work to be done to reach the Fed's 2 percent target.

As I've repeatedly said, the Fed's -- I think -- I think as I've repeatedly said, the commitment to independence of the Federal Reserve is of utmost importance, and it is critical especially in a political year like this. Just as -- Chair Powell, just as you did in previous administrations, you must not allow politics to cloud the Fed's monetary policy.

However, despite your best efforts, the Fed independence remains at risk, and unfortunately calls are coming from inside the building. Under Vice Chair Barr, the Fed's regulatory and supervisory agenda has become politicized. Most notably the development of the Basel III endgame proposal has been a mess.

This process has been cloaked in opaque standards and timelines set at meetings of unaccountable global -- global governance bodies. The Fed has promised to process 410 almost universally negative comments, public comments, regarding the unjustified and under-utilized initial proposal -- or an under-analyzed initial proposal.

Recent press reports, which seem to be the only way Congress gets details on the Basel III endgame progress, and your comments yesterday indicate the Fed will finally conduct a long overdue quantitative impact study. That is welcome. And if true, this is a promising, promising development. Chair Powell, the last time you testified before this committee, you stated that the initial Basel III endgame proposal will undergo "broad and material changes." Yesterday in the Senate, you said the board supports reissuing the updated proposal for public comment.


PATRICK MCHENRY:
I'm concerned that press reports also claim the Fed will tuck any changes to the proposal into this quantitative impact study. That study, including the substantial changes to the proposal, would then be issued for public feedback with relatively paltry comment period. I'll reiterate to you here what I've said to you in private. Broad and material changes to the Basel III endgame necessitate a full re-proposal, full stop, full stop.

Failure to do so will result in an immediate Congressional Review Act vote out of this House of Representatives as quickly as we can possibly process it. Now, it doesn't have to be this way, and I think the Fed adhering to its longstanding principles here is highly important, especially with this interagency process.

I'll close with this. Your steady and capable apolitical leadership of the Federal Reserve has shepherded our economy through extreme uncertainty. We now find ourselves in the midst of a new type of uncertainty surrounding the leadership of our nation. Doubts, fears and panic often lead to bad decision making and even worse policy.

I urge you to reject outside political pressure in this volatile time and stay the course for the good of the American people and our economy as a whole. Thank you for your service, and I yield back. I'll now recognize the ranking member of the full committee, Ms. Waters, for four minutes.


MAXINE WATERS:
Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Welcome back to the Honorable Jerome H Powell, chairman, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. Chair Powell, as we saw with the latest jobs report, the labor market remains strong and the economy is surging. Despite inheriting an economy from the prior administration that had the worst jobs record since the Great Depression, President Biden has now overseen a record 15.7 million jobs created since he took office, with 206,000 new jobs created just last month.

Not only that but, under the Biden administration, we're witnessing low unemployment rates, rising wages and stabilizing prices for goods and services. This is not only because of President Biden's strong leadership, but also because of the historic legislation signed into law by President Biden which has resulted in lower costs, created more jobs, rebuilt our infrastructure, supported small businesses, eliminated mostly junk fees, wiped out more than $144 billion in federal student loan debt for 14 million borrowers, and cut child poverty in half.

President Biden is and will continue to advance policies that are providing good paying jobs and an economy that works for everyone. Now, while I'm pleased to see that inflation -- inflation is declining, the latest data makes clear that housing remains the number one driver of core inflation. Since 2020, house prices have increased by nearly 50 percent, with Americans now spending on average over 30 percent of their income on housing.

This is a top priority for Democrat, but remains an afterthought for Republicans. Earlier this Congress, I reintroduced my comprehensive legislation housing package, including the Housing Crisis Response Act. This bill provides more than $150 billion in fair and affordable housing investments, representing the single largest investment in affordable housing in our nation's history.

These funds would create nearly 1.4 million affordable and accessible homes, bring down housing costs for all, and revive the American dream of home ownership. Committee Democrats are committed to getting this bill across the finish line and continue to hold out hope that our Republican colleagues will finally join us in this effort.

Unfortunately, extreme MAGA Republicans are not just ignoring housing inflation, they're advancing their Project 2025 manifesto that would dismantle US democracy and the economy as we know it today. Project 2025 is authored by almost two dozen former Trump White House staffers and Trump administration officials.

It was compiled and published by the ultra far right Heritage Foundation, whose CEO recently declared that they are "In the process of a second American Revolution, which will be bloodless if the left allows it to be." And if that kind of talk reminds anyone of the rhetoric we heard in the lead up to and on January 6th, 2020, it should.

Project 2025 promotes radical ideas to materially undermine the Federal Reserve, if not effectively abolish. MAGA wants to put out -- put you out of a job, Chairman Powell. So, I look forward to your testimony and hearing from you, a Republican who was first nominated by President Trump, about your thoughts on the importance of the Federal Reserve and the work you have done to help our economy.

And I yield back.


PATRICK MCHENRY:
The gentlelady yields back. I'd note for the records Jerome Powell was initially nominated by President Obama to the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve before being nominated by President Trump to chair. So, here we are. We'll recognize the chair of the Financial Institution's Subcommittee, Mr. Barr, the Andy Barr variety, for one minute.


ANDY BARR:
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Welcome, Chairman Powell. Runaway inflation and increased interest rates necessary to confront it continue to hammer Americans, and especially those living paycheck to paycheck. Workers and families feel the pain making everyday purchases at high prices in the grocery aisles and at the pump.

They have suffered years of eroding purchasing power in their paychecks under the Biden administration's economic mismanagement. Heightened mortgage rates make it prohibitive for new homebuyers to reach the American dream of a starter home for their family. I am pleased that the Fed is resolute in getting inflation under control.

I am pleased that you have committed to an apolitical approach to this. I am not pleased by the Fed's opaque, unjustified, politicized and under-analyzed regulatory proposals, which will ultimately hurt all Americans. We need to know where the Fed is going on its fundamentally flawed Basel III endgame proposal and its opaque regulatory approach.

I yield.


PATRICK MCHENRY:
Well, chair now recognizes the ranking member of the Financial Institutions Monetary Policy Subcommittee, Mr. Foster, for one minute.


BILL FOSTER:
Thank you, Chair McHenry and Ranking Member Waters. I'd like to also thank you, Chair Powell, for joining us today and for the role you have played in combating inflation and supporting a stable economic recovery. While the presidency is often the focus of political pronouncements about macroeconomic conditions, there's no question that that undersells the importance and the independence of the work of the Federal Reserve Board.

While actions taken by the president and Congress certainly play a significant role, monetary policy decisions made by an independent Federal Reserve are the big dog in shaping macroeconomic conditions that shape economic outcomes for millions of Americans. And work continues on inflation, but significant progress has been made to bring the country in line with the Fed's 2 percent target.

The good news is that macroeconomic policy is working as designed. Well-calibrated monetary policy with fiscal support from the American Rescue Plan, the Infrastructure and Jobs Act, and the CHIPS and Science Act has powered strong job creation and low unemployment while staving off a recession that many thought inevitable and far better, I should point out, than our peer countries, while Democrats are committed to supporting your efforts to cut costs for American families.

I yield back.


PATRICK MCHENRY:
We'll now welcome the testimony of Jerome Powell, the 16th chair of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors. Chair Powell, you'll be recognized for five minutes to give an oral presentation of your testimony. Without -- without objection, your written statement will be made a part of the record. You're now recognized for five minutes.


JEROME POWELL:
Chairman McHenry, Ranking Member Waters, and other members of the committee, I appreciate the opportunity to present the Federal Reserve's semiannual monetary policy report. The Federal Reserve remains squarely focused on our dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the benefit of the American people.

Over the past two years, the economy has made considerable progress toward the Federal Reserve's 2 percent inflation goal, and labor market conditions have cooled while remaining strong. Reflecting these developments, the risks to achieving our employment and inflation goals are coming into better balance.

I will review -- review the current economic situation before turning to monetary policy. Recent indicators suggest that the US economy continues to expand at a solid pace. Gross domestic product growth appears to have moderated in the first half of this year, following impressive strength in the second half of last year.

Private domestic demand remains robust, however, with slower but still solid increases in consumer spending. We've also been moderate -- we've also seen moderate growth in capital spending and a pickup in residential investment so far this year. Improving supply conditions have supported resilient demand and the strong performance of the US economy over the past year.

In the labor market, a broad set of indicators suggests that conditions have returned to about where they stood on the eve of the pandemic, strong but not overheated. The unemployment rate has moved higher, but was still at a low level of 4.1 percent in June. Payroll job gains averaged 222,000 jobs per month in the first half of the year.

Strong job creation over the past couple of years has been accompanied by an increase in the supply of workers, reflecting increases in labor force participation among individuals aged 25 to 54 and a strong pace of immigration. As a result, the jobs to workers gap is well down from its peak and now stands just a bit above its 2019 level.

Nominal wage growth has eased over the past year. The strong labor market has helped narrow longstanding disparities in employment and earnings across demographic groups. Inflation has eased notably over the past couple of years, but remains above the committee's longer run goal of 2 percent. Total PCE prices rose 2.6 percent over the 12 months ending in May. Core PCE prices, which exclude the volatile food and energy categories, also increased 2.6 percent.

After a lack of progress toward our 2 percent inflation objective in the early part of this year, the most recent monthly readings have shown modest further progress. Longer term inflation expectations appear to remain well anchored, as reflected in a broad range of surveys of households, businesses and forecasters, as well as measures from financial markets.

Our monetary policy actions are guided by our dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people. In support of these goals, the committee has maintained the target range for the federal funds rate at 5.25 to 5.5 percent since last July, after having tightened the stance of monetary policy significantly over the previous year and a half.

We have also continued to reduce our securities holdings. At our May meeting, we decided to slow the pace of balance sheet runoff starting in June consistent with the plans released previously. Our restrictive monetary policy stance is helping to bring demand and supply into better balance and to put downward pressure on inflation.

The committee has stated that we do not expect it will be appropriate to reduce the target range for the federal funds rate until we have gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2 percent. Incoming data for the first quarter of this year did not support such greater confidence.

The most recent inflation readings, however, have shown some modest further progress, and more good data would strengthen our confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2 percent. We continue to make decisions meeting by meeting. We know that reducing policy restraint too soon or too much could stall or even reverse the progress that we've seen on inflation.

At the same time, in light of the progress made both in lowering inflation and in cooling the labor market over the past two years, elevated inflation is not the only risk we face. Reducing policy restraint too late or too little could unduly weaken economic activity and employment. In considering adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the committee will continue its practice of carefully assessing incoming data and their implications for the evolving outlook, the balance of risks, and the appropriate path of monetary policy.

Congress has entrusted the Fed with the operational independence that is needed to take a longer term perspective in the pursuit of our dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability. We remain committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal and to keeping longer term inflation expectations well anchored.

Restoring price stability is essential to achieving maximum employment and stable prices over the long run. Our success in delivering on those goals matters to all Americans. I'll conclude by emphasizing that we understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country. Everything we do is in service to our public mission.

Thank you. I look forward to your questions.


PATRICK MCHENRY:
Well, thank you, Chair Powell. I'll now recognize myself for -- for five minutes. Chair Powell, let -- let's begin with this question of the Basel III endgame. I know you got questions about it yesterday, but I think we need further clarity. Your testimony about Vice Chair Barr's discussions with the FDIC and with the OCC on the next steps for the Basel III endgame, you mentioned potential changes have been made to the original Basel III endgame and that a lot of progress has been made, and that the board is very close to agreeing on the substance of those changes.

But the next steps, that's really what I want to get into. Let's get through the mechanics of what happens next. If the Fed, the OCC and the FDIC agree on the substance of whatever changes you're going to make, um, what happens then? Like walk through the mechanics as you anticipate it?


JEROME POWELL:
OK, um, so we are -- we're very close to having exactly that agreement on the substance of the proposed changes pursuant to those talks. Uh, the next question then is how to proceed. And um, you know, it is my view and the strong view of -- of a number of board members that the appropriate thing to do is to take that new proposal and publish it along with the effects of the quantitative impact survey and put that out for comment again and receive comment on that and then take some time to review those comments before finalizing the regulation.

And, um, that's the discussion we're having with the other two agencies now. We have not been able to reach agreement on a path to do that, but that's something that we're, you know, we think is the right way to do that's. That's what we've done in -- in similar situations, there aren't that many similar situations.

But when we see broader material changes to an important regulation, we think let's go out again and give all the commenters another chance to comment.


PATRICK MCHENRY:
Yeah, and that also avoids serious lawsuit risk and the risk that Congress step in and overturn this rulemaking using the Congressional Review Act. I think the other agencies here, if they're not agreeing with the Fed, they're running against the independence of the Federal Reserve here. This is not a trifling matter of policy.

This is a matter of real substance for the independence of the Fed and rule making at the Federal Reserve, um, which I think we should be able to keep. These, keep the independence of the fed separate um especially in this political environment. But opening it up to a new comment period, um, so that means you have to get consensus for the board of governors on the policy.

You have to get the agreement of the scandal-plagued chair of the FDIC or the -- the five member board of the FDIC. You have to get agreement by the acting comptroller of the currency. These people should not have real standing against with the -- with the Fed on a matter of serious policy, especially with a chair of the FDIC that is being ousted by his own party as soon as they can get a replacement confirmed.

It's an absurd thing that the Fed has to go to an acting comptroller of the currency and a guy who's going to be out of a job very soon at the FDIC and get agreement. Um, but thank you for listening. That was more of a -- to convey this. So the quantitative impact analysis is this going to include the interplay with the stress tests?

Uh, GSIB surcharge, all the other capital charges here, will that be a part of the quantitative impact analysis?


JEROME POWELL:
It will be this proposal, which does include changes to the GSIB surcharge, but does not include the stress test.


PATRICK MCHENRY:
OK, um, but -- but the goal here with the quantitative impact is to actually measure the impact of these rules as enacted, right? Based upon what is existing regulatory structures. OK.


JEROME POWELL:
That's right.


PATRICK MCHENRY:
All right. So let's get into the question of balance sheet as quickly as we can. You two-and-a-half years ago, um, you know, you stated quote, "The committee stand -- the committee intends to slow and then stop the decline in the size of the balance sheet when reserve balances are somewhat above the level it judges to be consistent with ample reserves." Um, that's two-and-a-half years ago, where are we in this question of what -- what are ample reserves?


JEROME POWELL:
Well, so the balance sheet, the run off in the portfolio is now I think $1.7 trillion so far. So we've made quite a lot of progress. We think we have a good ways to go. And as -- as I mentioned and as you just mentioned, we've now slowed the pace really with a view to getting as far as we can without creating frictions and disruption that would -- might cause us to prematurely stop shrinking.

Going a little bit slower might actually enable us to go further. We think we have quite a ways to go. It's very hard to be precise about it. It's really a question of supply and demand and we will find that that level with a little bit of a buffer on top of it and that's where we'll stop.


PATRICK MCHENRY:
All right, thank you for your testimony. Uh, the ranking member, Ms. Waters is recognized for five minutes.


MAXINE WATERS:
Thank you very much. Chairman Powell, are you familiar with Project 2025?


JEROME POWELL:
Not really, no.


MAXINE WATERS:
You've heard about it.


JEROME POWELL:
I really don't focus on these things at all.


MAXINE WATERS:
You don't focus, but you know there's something known as a Project 2025. The reason I'm asking you is because one proposal is to get rid of the Fed's dual mandate to promote only stable prices, but also maximum employment -- employment. This is your mandate. These are mandates, right? This is what you do, is that right?


JEROME POWELL:
We do serve a dual mandate.


MAXINE WATERS:
That's right and so if there was anything that would get rid of the mandate, what would it do to our economy, What would it do to our country?


JEROME POWELL:
So the question of which mandate we serve is very much a question for Congress. Our own -- my own view has been that the dual mandate has served us well. This is something Congress can change and change back to a single mandate. There are --


MAXINE WATERS:
-- What do you do to get maximum employment? What do you do?


JEROME POWELL:
Well, um, we basically we have one tool on the economy and that is we raise and lower interest rates. You'll find though that anyway -- we certainly at the fed do believe that -- that the dual mandate has -- has been a good thing and it's enabled us to -- it has not stopped us from controlling inflation when that was the thing that needed to be done.


MAXINE WATERS:
And so while of course, I understand you may not have seen, heard or read Project 2025, are you familiar with a effort in the country to get rid of diversity and inclusion?


JEROME POWELL:
I see these things mentioned, but honestly we're, you know, we're pretty focused on our task which is -- which is maximum employment and price stability. We're strong supporters of -- of diversity at the Fed as you know.


MAXINE WATERS:
Are you aware that I created a subcommittee on diversity and employment in this committee?


JEROME POWELL:
Yes, I remember that.


MAXINE WATERS:
And do you think that, um, getting rid of diversity and inclusion interferes with your ability to really realize the mandate of maximum employment?


JEROME POWELL:
I -- so I've -- you know, I was uh spent most of my career in the private sector and what I observed was really successful institutions in the United States, companies, organizations generally are those that do a really good job on diversity and get the best out of people. And attract a broad, diverse range of talents to the table.

And people feel comfortable speaking. So that's -- that's the way we feel about it at the Fed and that's -- that's what we've been doing and we'll continue to do.


MAXINE WATERS:
And do you think it's important not only to have diversity and inclusion, um, in the public sector, but in the private sector also?


JEROME POWELL:
Yes, and as I mentioned, if you look at very successful American companies, you will very often see that they're -- they're good at that they're good at hiring, attracting, investing in and keeping diverse talent. That's one of the things that are really good US public companies do well.


MAXINE WATERS:
Have you seen improvement during your tenure where diversity and inclusion has created opportunities for more jobs and have to reduce the unemployment rate?


JEROME POWELL:
Certainly seen, um, uh, I think you see over the course of my long career, a big change in diversity and inclusion, um, and you see that in the private sector and the public sector. And I think that's generally progress. I do.


MAXINE WATERS:
Uh, under the work of this committee and the subcommittee is chaired by Ms. Beatty, she was able to gather important data about what was going on in the private sector. And what she discovered was that many of the CEOs and others welcomed the opportunity to learn more and to do better and to get assistance.

And we start -- we saw improvement with diversity and inclusion. Have you seen that?


JEROME POWELL:
There's no question, if you talk to CEOs, they -- they get this. If you want to attract the best talent in -- in our country now you need to be -- you need to be committed to these things.


MAXINE WATERS:
And so I would like to compliment you on the job that you have been doing. I'd like to compliment you on keeping us informed about inflation. Not only do I welcome you here today, I look forward to working with you for years to come. I yield back. Thank you.


JEROME POWELL:
Thank you.


PATRICK MCHENRY:
The gentleman from Arkansas, the vice chair of the full committee, Mr. Hill is now recognized for five minutes.


FRENCH HILL:
I thank the chair. Chair Powell. Thanks so much and welcome back to the committee. I want to pick up where Senator Tim Scott and Chair McHenry left off and reiterate my strong support for your comment yesterday in the Senate about the need to re-propose the Basel III endgame. The Supreme Court's precedent I think makes clear that if a rule undergoes broad and material changes from the proposal to final rule, the public must be giving a meaningful opportunity to review and comment on those changes.

You generally share that view, I think is that right?


JEROME POWELL:
Yes.


FRENCH HILL:
Um, and I'm looking forward to seeing the results of the quantitative impact study and the separate comment period as well as an interagency agreement you referenced yesterday because of Dodd-Frank's role in the vice chair for supervision, Vice Chairman Barr's role and the Fed's role. Is it -- would it be fair to say the Fed is a first among equals on proposing a rule like this?

In other words, does the Fed have a supremacy position on determining whether it should be fully re-proposed or not or do you view it strictly as a collaborative basis? Just curious in your view on that.


JEROME POWELL:
I would say it's strictly collaborative and I would say that our discussions with the FDIC, which -- which Vice Chair Barr has actually been conducting and the OCC, they've been very productive so far. So I want to make sure to say that we've -- we've continued to work our way through this and I -- I believe we will get fairly soon to -- to a resolution of the remaining process issue.


FRENCH HILL:
Good. Well, let me -- let me turn from that subject to the court's recent decision to overturn the so-called Chevron doctrine. Many of us believe this was the first step to reining in decades literally of an unprecedented, uncontrolled growth in the administrative state. And so I think all of us on at least this side of the aisle are certainly saying to the Federal Reserve and other federal agencies in our jurisdiction that we want to reassert Article I authority over the direction that independent agencies work.

Would it be fair to ask you to certify that because of this change in Chevron that the Fed would commit to promulgating new rules only if they're at the direction of an explicit Congressional authorization?


JEROME POWELL:
So I -- I think, um, first of all we're -- we're studying that and several other decisions that have just come down in the last week or two. So I haven't got anything definitive for you on that. I think you know us to be an organization, I know us to be an organization that is strongly committed to the rule of law.

Supreme Court says what the law is, we'll always do what we believe the law is.


FRENCH HILL:
Well, I'll submit that question maybe in more detail in writing and maybe you'll have a chance to reflect on that. Back in February you were on 60 Minutes and you said the US budget deficit, the national debt are unsustainable. Do you still view that the US is on an unsustainable fiscal path?


JEROME POWELL:
I do. So I was -- I think I tried to be clear that the level of the US debt is not itself unsustainable, but the path that we're on is unsustainable and I think that is not controversial.


FRENCH HILL:
I think many of us certainly agree with that and we know that when the -- the deficits at three times the economic growth rate and growing, it's -- it's a concern and it's contributed to inflation. Just three years ago in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, you gave a speech where you were confident that inflation was transitory, which I think we've come to realize that's not the case.

This hearing sort of a can't miss opportunity for the fed to demonstrate some humility on the monetary policy decisions which some on this side of the aisle particularly think have made inflation worse. Your August 2020 Jackson Hole speech, you said the flexible average inflation targeting framework regarding 2 percent, that would -- you would let it run above 2 percent.

Was the Fed blinded by the previous 20 years of -- of global change that was deflationary and not -- you were not alert enough in 2020 to be more cautious about that change in policy?


JEROME POWELL:
So we were certainly mindful of a long period of time in which there have been very low-interest rates, but also very low inflation suggesting that the neutral interest rate must have fallen quite substantially. That was the standard view. Um, the thing we didn't see coming was the pandemic. It's not like everything went off the rails.

It's like we had this pandemic and it really changed the way the economy is working. We had a big crisis. We did a lot of things. So the concerns that led us to -- those concerns that we were in a world of very low interest rates all the time.


FRENCH HILL:
But now wouldn't you say we're in a very opposite situation where because of reshoring and tariffs and other policies that are quite inflationary?


JEROME POWELL:
I was -- well, I would say this, those concerns are right now we have the policy rate in the -- in the mid fives, right? And -- and we don't see -- we see that policy is restrictive. But clearly interest rates, the neutral interest rate must have moved up at least in the short term. So I think that's the question we'll be asking ourselves in our review which begins at the end of this year --


FRENCH HILL:
-- We look -- we look forward to that. I yield back to the chairman --


JEROME POWELL:
-- is how much of what we did in -- in the how much of what we did in -- in -- in that time period is irrelevant to the new world where rates appear to be higher.


PATRICK MCHENRY:
The gentleman from Georgia, Mr. Scott is recognized for five minutes.




DAVID SCOTT:
Thank you, Chairman and welcome, Chair Powell. It's great seeing you. Last time I saw you, you had -- we had the gracious pleasure of you visiting with me in my office and we discussed a great variety of things. Thank you for that visit. Now this year, the Fed tested 31 banks up from 23 last year, is that correct?


JEROME POWELL:
I believe that's right, yes.


DAVID SCOTT:
And by estimating losses, revenues, expenses and capital level under hypothetical stress scenarios, we did that correct?


JEROME POWELL:
Yes.


DAVID SCOTT:
And all 31 banks remained above their minimum common equity tier one capital requirements after observing losses of nearly $685 billion. Is that correct?


JEROME POWELL:
Yes, that is correct.


DAVID SCOTT:
Yeah, I wanted to get those figures out and provide you with, uh, you may have heard this, but I want to share it with the nation because of your Vice Chair Barr made this statement and I wanted to put this in the record his exact quote from this great achievement, he said, "Our goal of our stress test is to help ensure that we have enough capital to absorb losses in a highly stressful scenario and this test shows that we do." I thought that was a great statement, uh, of your record.

Now let me ask you my question, it's simple will the 2024 Fed stress test results have an impact on how prudential regulators roll out a new and updated capital proposal?


JEROME POWELL:
So the two are really two different things. Um, there's the -- there's the Basel III capital proposal and then there's the stress test. So -- and really the Basel III, uh, as I mentioned, we've discussed, we're almost ready to put forward for further comment, a revised proposal with material and broad changes to it. The stress tests are a different thing.

And of course we tried it, we realize we have to adapt those over time and be open to changes. And we -- we, you know, we have -- it has evolved significantly over time, but it's really a separate thing from the Basel III endgame.


DAVID SCOTT:
Give us a little bit more information on Basel III because I worked with you with this. Our work goes all the way back to the Obama administration when we responded to that crisis with, uh, our banks. And you and I worked that up where we came up with the Hardest Hit program to help those who were suffering with -- those states that were suffering with high unemployment and at the same time high home foreclosures and we were successful and we've established that program and it's still going on and helping many of our states.

But, uh, you know, I want to also share what is happening around the world as a result of our activities. The European Union is now set to delay key parts of its bank capital rules by more than a year so that their leaders -- lenders will not be at a disadvantage. Over in Canada, it's important to know that their banking regulators have also delayed for another year imposing high capital rules on country's banks at the risk of making them uncompetitive.

And the Swiss National Bank is highly unlikely now to adopt a proposed 15 percent capital requirement for UPS and other Swiss banks. And the Bank of England has issued a near-final proposal to increase UK bank capital by 3.2 percent. Uh, and I think this is all a measure of your great work and that of your vice chair.

And I just wanted to let you have a comment on that, please.


JEROME POWELL:
Sure. So we're committed to finalizing this proposal. Our banks are going to live with these rules for a long, long time. The main thing is to get it right and that's what we're doing. We -- what we do in the end will be consistent with the -- with the Basel agreement and it will also be consistent with what other comparable large jurisdictions are doing.


DAVID SCOTT:
You're doing a great job, keep up the good work.


PATRICK MCHENRY:
We'll recognize the gentleman from Pennsylvania, Mr. Meuser for five minutes.


DANIEL MEUSER:
Thank you very much. Mr. Chairman, I thank you very much, Chairman Powell, and also thank you for continued indicate that you will look at the entirety of the economy, the whole economy. We appreciate that. So one of the nation's largest banks recently warned in a memo and it's also been voiced by smaller banks that the current pace of regulations such as changes to capital requirements and lowering debit card interchange caps could lead to a new fees associated -- associated with checking accounts.

And other increased costs for small businesses. This does come amid expiring tax provisions that are sunsetting as we speak that are critical for small business such as the R&D tax credit and interest deductibility and bonus depreciation. This does raise the question, are you considering how these regulations and tax increases will directly work against your mandate to achieve 2 percent inflation?

Moreover, what the proposed changes to Basel III, it is crucial to ensure that all stakeholders have a voice in this process which you are stating will occur and a Basel re-proposal, an adequate comment period are certainly very welcome. So, Chairman Powell, yesterday in the Senate, you mentioned that the majority view of the board is to re-propose Basel III for comment period.

Could you clarify if this means the proposal will be -- will be re-proposed from scratch and any other specifics you can provide?


JEROME POWELL:
Sure, so we haven't reached agreement on this. As I mentioned, we're working through this with our -- with our colleagues at the FDIC and the OCC. Um, and I can't tell you exactly what the form of it would be. The sense of it would be though that we're making material changes and that we would want the public to have a chance to look at those changes in the light of the way they play off against the quantitative impact survey and should have a reasonable time to comment on those.

In addition, you know, they're -- they're, you know, we're focused on one big area, uh, but there are -- there are institutions that have made comments all across the spectrum and we're reading all of those carefully and we're not going to -- we're not going to, uh, you know, republish All of those we'll some of those we can just make changes and move forward on. So that's -- that's -- it's going to be a very labor intensive time consuming process.

Writing these things up takes a long time and, you know, we're going to get it right.


DANIEL MEUSER:
Good. That's great. Obviously, you know, Canada recently postponed as did the EU and UK for international competition standpoint, it seems to make make sense. And so that's appreciated. Uh, Chairman, would you agree that excessive spending, increased taxes, uh, limits on domestic energy production in principle are cause for higher costs for business, contributes to inflation and in -- and as well tightens the labor markets kind of running contrary to your two mandates?


JEROME POWELL:
You know, you're asking me kind of a political question there. I'm not going to -- I don't want to criticize a platform of economic fiscal policies that are not really ours to decide.


DANIEL MEUSER:
That's really -- it's more of an economic question, but I appreciate your answer, sir. So when you mentioned recalibrate policy yesterday in the Senate hearing was part of your thinking taking a more holistic view of economic conditions?


JEROME POWELL:
Yes, very much so.


DANIEL MEUSER:
Okay, yeah. Okay. Uh, Chairman, is there any data to support the so-called greedflation This term greedflation somehow has caused inflation. Is there any data to support those comments?


JEROME POWELL:
So we -- we look at it that inflation, this inflation has been caused by a combination of you know very strong demand and constrained supply. So it was really a high-speed collision between an economy that was reopening. And by the way, this was -- there was inflation all -- all over the world at the same time so these are some common factors, But at the same time you had tremendous demand, for example for automobiles, you had constrained supply because there weren't enough semiconductors, long story short.

But, um, you know, so that -- that's to us is, is what inflation this inflation is all about. So we've observed, you know, the sort of healing of the supply side. At the same time, restrictive monetary policies weighing on demand and we've seen inflation coming down.


DANIEL MEUSER:
So there's no data that supports that gouging of consumers is part of the inflation.


JEROME POWELL:
It's been very hard to track connection with you know, earnings and things.


DANIEL MEUSER:
Secretary Yellen mentioned that she didn't feel that there was grocery, uh, price shock and that sort of thing. Groceries and gasoline are the two driving problems for American families and certainly my constituents, do you believe your policies are helping to alleviate in those two areas?


JEROME POWELL:
So a lot of things affect, let's take energy first. You know the energy prices are generally set at the global level. We do have some effect on that.


DANIEL MEUSER:
Sorry, Chairman. I've run out of time. Thank you. I yield back Mr. -- sorry.


JEROME POWELL:
We can continue.


DANIEL MEUSER:
Great. Thanks.


PATRICK MCHENRY:
The gentleman from Missouri, Mr. Cleaver is now recognized for five minutes.


EMANUEL CLEAVER:
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for -- for being here. Um, and in some ways I want to follow up or at least respond to the very civil. But, um, I think reason of why we need an independent central bank, uh, and your response was, you know, the -- the question you raised would -- if I answered it, it would be a long -- some kind of a political uh, uh avenue.

And you didn't want to drive on that avenue. So I'm -- I'm also very much concerned about a lot of the discussion I've been on this committee for a while and so it comes up quite often. Um, when the Federal Reserve was birthed around the turn of the century, I think around, uh, the 1913, 1918, somewhere like that.

Uh, prior to the establishment of the central bank did we was our country experiencing a lot of recessions. Um, because of uh, you know, no, no security people felt no security, particularly the business community in making big investments because nobody was in control. Just kind of think what went on just went on, is that right?


JEROME POWELL:
Yes. I think the lack of a central bank between 1836 and the founding of the Fed was a period of lots and lots of depressions. And -- and a lot of it had to do with the crop cycle and the banks not being able to handle the very large seasonal swings and there was no central bank to provide liquidity. So that's -- and that's really what -- what gave rise to the founding of the Fed in the early part of the last century.


EMANUEL CLEAVER:
Do you think that it would be -- that it is dangerous to blend monetary policy and fiscal policy?


JEROME POWELL:
To blend them?


EMANUEL CLEAVER:
Yes.


JEROME POWELL:
So we -- we try to keep them very separate and you know we -- we don't -- we try not to you know, express views on fiscal policy that's -- that's for elected people who have, you know, undergone elections and won and make those very difficult decisions. We have a really specific narrow but important mandate that we do that you've given us and we try to stick to that.

And, uh, so uh, we take your policies as given and uh, and then we conduct monetary policy with -- with -- with that.


EMANUEL CLEAVER:
Um, I don't -- I don't want to draw you into any kind of a political response, but -- and I have not read all of this Project 2025 document. I read some of it online a couple of nights ago, uh, but even whether it comes out of a 2025 or 30, 89, whatever the -- one of the things that -- that I'm concerned about look, reading this from this, this little -- this document, uh, that the -- the document argues that the Federal Reserve is the inflation problem, um and eliminating the Federal Reserve imposing economic policy on the Fed that does not come from within the Fed. Uh, so um, I -- I'm wondering here, uh, would you agree uh with -- with any of that?

I just -- I just stated whether -- whether it came from me or Chairman McHenry or anybody else?


JEROME POWELL:
So I'll just say first of all, you know, we're certainly fair game for any criticism people have. I think we've -- what we've learned and what we know is that having an independent central bank is -- is really essential if you want, if you want to have high and volatile inflation, then the quickest road to that would be to undermine the independence of the central bank, of the Fed in our case.

So I frankly think that that view is very widely held I find up here on Capitol Hill in both political parties.


EMANUEL CLEAVER:
So -- so eliminating the Federal Reserve is -- is best for promoting economic stability?


JEROME POWELL:
Yes.


EMANUEL CLEAVER:
Thank you, um, uh, I knew that our chair that our -- the ranking member was going to come in and deal with the issue of housing. She always does. And we all appreciate the fact that she's obsessed with it, and I like that obsession. But I'm -- I'm wondering, as we try to figure out how to deal with this -- this -- this issue -- oh, my goodness, my -- my time ran out.


JEROME POWELL:
Is that a question?


EMANUEL CLEAVER:
I didn't finish it, but sure. Yes, if you -- if you -- if you knew where I was going, please.


PATRICK MCHENRY:
Gentleman's time's expired. We'll now recognize the gentleman from New York, Mr. Garbarino, for five minutes.


ANDREW GARBARINO:
Thank you, Chairman. Chair Powell, thank you very much for being here today. Based on some comments made today and yesterday, it appears you've made quite a bit of progress on changes to the Basel III endgame proposal. And -- and you're very close to agreeing to some of those, the substance of those changes.

I know you won't get into specifics. You've said that. I just don't know how deep you won't get into them. But I just want to confirm what you said to my colleague, Mr. Meuser. There will be -- you're not re-proposing some things. It's just going to be a partial re-proposal.


JEROME POWELL:
That's what we're looking at doing is major things that we've been working on. And there -- there will be additional changes that'll be made that won't be re-proposed. That's -- that's what we're working on, rather than a full, wide proposal.


ANDREW GARBARINO:
So, just -- so, it's -- it's not a complete re-proposal, just partial?


JEROME POWELL:
Yeah. Can you -- can you get at least into -- can you tell me if -- which components you're -- You know, it's -- it's not -- until it's -- until it's all agreed and ready to go and vetted, I'm -- I'm reluctant to try to get into too many specifics, just because -- you know, when you're doing these things, nothing is agreed until everything is agreed.


ANDREW GARBARINO:
No, I understand. I just --


JEROME POWELL:
Yeah.


ANDREW GARBARINO:
I'm not asking for what specifically are changes --


JEROME POWELL:
Yeah.


ANDREW GARBARINO:
Whether -- which -- if you're willing to say which --


JEROME POWELL:
We -- I hope to be able to come to you --


ANDREW GARBARINO:
Okay.


JEROME POWELL:
With a -- with a really clear answer on that soon. I mean, I think we -- we're ready --


ANDREW GARBARINO:
I understand.


JEROME POWELL:
We're ready to go at the Fed.


ANDREW GARBARINO:
So, that's -- and that's my next question. So, it's been said several times that you and many of your members of the board are at odds with your counterparts at the FDIC and OCC over how to proceed with putting out a revised proposal for comment. So, if the FDIC and the OCC are not yet on board with allowing for a new comment period, who is holding up this consensus?

Is it Chair Gruenberg? Is it Director Chopra?


JEROME POWELL:
I don't want to say that we're at odds. I just want to say we're -- we're working through this issue together. And --


ANDREW GARBARINO:
Someone's got to be holding it up.


JEROME POWELL:
Well, you know, we're -- it's -- it's a discussion that we're having, and I -- I think it's been constructive. And I think we'll try to keep it that way.


ANDREW GARBARINO:
So, can you at least answer whether or not the five member FDIC board needs to sign off or -- or can -- can you just go to the chair?


JEROME POWELL:
No, I think -- I think it's the board. And of course, the comptroller is -- is one person. But I think it's -- I mean, the FDIC can speak for themselves. But I do think their board would be the -- the question.


ANDREW GARBARINO:
Okay. One final question now, a timeline question before we move on. You mentioned yesterday that a reasonable prediction would be that Basel would not be finalized until the first quarter of 2025. Under this timeline, would it be safe to say that implementation would then not occur until at least the beginning of 2026?


JEROME POWELL:
I -- I -- again, I can't be that specific. And, you know, that's -- someone asked me does -- does it sound like the first quarter of next year might be, and I said it might be. I mean, there's a range of times it would take. The thing is, as I mentioned, US banks are going to be living with these rules for many years.

The point of it is to get it right, not to -- not to do it quickly. You know, we want to --


ANDREW GARBARINO:
I understand.


JEROME POWELL:
Get it right, listen to the comments, make sound decisions, and move ahead in a way that -- that is -- you know, gives us a sustainable set of rules that we won't have to come back and fix all the mistakes in.


ANDREW GARBARINO:
Thank you. I want to move on to a other topic, long term debt. You mentioned yesterday that you would like -- most likely not move forward with other rules until people reach a place of understanding and acceptance of a revised Basel proposal. I hope that's the truth, as banks need to fully understand the implications of a Basel proposal before any action is taken on long term debt.

Finally, Chair Powell, I'd like to emphasize the need for the Fed to conduct a comprehensive, data driven, and most importantly, transparent assessment of the current liquidity framework. So, very quickly, will you commit to conducting a public quantitative impact study and a full notice and comment rulemaking before imposing any new liquidity requirements?


JEROME POWELL:
I didn't catch the first part of that, the -- the first part of your ask.


ANDREW GARBARINO:
Will you commit to conducting a public quantitative impact study and a full notice and comment rulemaking before imposing any new liquidity requirements?


JEROME POWELL:
On the liquidity thing, I -- I'm not exactly sure what -- what -- what we're contemplating there. We certainly contemplate getting a full range of input from the public on that, because these are -- some of these are novel ideas, and we understand that.


ANDREW GARBARINO:
All right. As the chairman said before, these impact studies are very important because they're -- they're to show what impact these rules will have. So, I -- I think that is a very important that we have that, because we had a mucked up process with Basel 2.0 and I don't think there's -- we don't want to repeat that.

And I have a little time left. I'm going to yield back -- yield to my -- my colleague from Pennsylvania, Mr. Meuser, because I know he had another question.


DANIEL MEUSER:
I thank my colleague. Chair Powell, just back to what we were talking about, the price instability of groceries and gasoline, where we do have somewhat of an affordability crisis as has been -- been termed. So, would lowering rates in the near future be a pro-growth initiative perhaps? Is that something that's being considered that would actually drive investment and give a clearer picture for investment, and perhaps help in these two categories and, in the end, increasing supply so as we lower those -- those prices?


JEROME POWELL:
So, honestly, when we think about our near term rate moves, we're thinking about a couple of things, and the first of which is we want to be more confident about inflation.


DANIEL MEUSER:
My apologies, Chairman. I went over.


JEROME POWELL:
Sorry.


DANIEL MEUSER:
Chairman, I yield back. I yield back to my colleague.


PATRICK MCHENRY:
The gentleman from California, Mr. Vargas, is recognized for five minutes.


JUAN VARGAS:
Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, and thank you again for this hearing. And the ranking member, thank you very much. Chairman Powell, thank you very much for being here. We appreciate it. In fact, I was looking at your history when they were saying who nominated you, when you got here, and all that. In fact, you had had public service even prior to that time, right?


JEROME POWELL:
That's right.


JUAN VARGAS:
So, I thank you for your long public service to the nation. I think --


JEROME POWELL:
Thank you.


JUAN VARGAS:
You've been outstanding. I think we all --


JEROME POWELL:
Appreciate it.


JUAN VARGAS:
Respect you deeply here. You're pretty boring here today, to be frank.


JEROME POWELL:
Sorry?


JUAN VARGAS:
You're pretty boring here, to be frank.


JEROME POWELL:
Thank you. That's a [Laughter] -- that's a high compliment.


JUAN VARGAS:
Yes, it is, because sometimes when you're here, there's all sorts of cameras here and they're watching your every step and all. And I think there's a reason for that, right? And that's because the economy is doing all right. Am I wrong about that?


JEROME POWELL:
You know, the -- take a look at our economy. We're growing at around 2 percent, it feels like. Inflation is down to 2.5, 2.6 percent. Unemployment's at 4.1. These are good numbers.


JUAN VARGAS:
Yeah. I mean, I hear the parade of horribles on the other side, how the sky is falling, but I don't see the media here to attest to that. In fact, just the opposite. Did you read some of the headlines of the new government in Britain? Some of the -- the headlines have not -- let me read one. It says new British government inherits worst economic plight since World War II. And in fact, there's a number of headlines like that, saying that England's in trouble.

I imagine if you were running, you know their central bank, I bet you there'd be a whole bunch of media here beating you up to find out, you know, what the hell you're doing or what you aren't doing. And I think the reason for that, again, is I think the government here has done a pretty darn good job. One of the things you said you didn't see coming was the pandemic, right?

I'm not putting words in your mouth.


JEROME POWELL:
Right.


JUAN VARGAS:
In fact, I was here and I heard the parade of horribles that we were going to have a recession, maybe a depression. In fact, the country's going to fall apart. Did it?


JEROME POWELL:
No. We went through a period of high inflation, as the other -- as the other countries did, and, you know, that's -- that's very challenging for people.


JUAN VARGAS:
And in fact, isn't it the case that most of those countries had higher inflation than we did in Europe?


JEROME POWELL:
Over the -- over time, there were times when their inflation was higher.


JUAN VARGAS:
Yeah, it was.


JEROME POWELL:
I think overall it was broadly comparable.


JUAN VARGAS:
Yeah. In fact, I've brought it up a number of times here, because there was a whole bunch of those countries that had much higher inflation than we did.


JEROME POWELL:
Well, they had -- Europe was much harder hit with the energy issues coming out of the Ukraine war than we were.


JUAN VARGAS:
Sure. I mean, there's a whole bunch of other issues to instability. They had political instability and a whole bunch of other things, obviously. But, I mean, it is interesting today that, you know, the -- the parade of horribles that we hear doesn't seem to manifest itself with the media or the attention that you normally get.

And that's good. I mean, I think it's a great thing. Now, I do want to ask a couple of questions. I do have concerns, Basel III on housing. I think I've made those concerns known to your office, and -- and I won't rehash them. But I do have issues that I want to talk to you about with regard to climate. Obviously, you said you don't read too much of the news.

You didn't hear about Project '25. I don't think that's what you meant to say, and I don't want to put words in your mouth. I think when the -- the -- the ranking member asked you if you had heard about it, I think you said no. I think you've probably heard about it, but you haven't read it.


JEROME POWELL:
I've -- I've seen nothing more than headlines on it. I mean, I've devoted zero --


JUAN VARGAS:
Yeah. Me too. I don't read the --


JEROME POWELL:
Zero energy to -- into --


JUAN VARGAS:
Yeah, I don't read that wacky stuff myself either, but I certainly read the headlines. But the reason I ask about the headlines, because you obviously have seen what has happened in Texas. You've -- you've seen what has happened with the climate change. And in fact you've testified I think before that you believe in climate change.

Is that correct?


JEROME POWELL:
Sure.


JUAN VARGAS:
Yeah. And so, how are -- what are we doing? You've taken a number of steps, I think, that have been very positive to make sure that we look at the risks of climate change. Could you go over some of those? Because that does concern me. I think that's a change that we also didn't see -- well, we saw -- I saw it coming.

I've been saying it for a long time. But a lot of people didn't believe.


JEROME POWELL:
So, you know, if you're looking at financial regulators, you're looking at people who have a very, very limited role in -- in climate. And that is just to look at the institutions that we supervise and make sure that they understand and can manage the risks that they're running. That -- we -- we are not climate policy makers.

It's --


JUAN VARGAS:
Right, right. And I'm not asking that.


JEROME POWELL:
It has to be elected people who do that.


JUAN VARGAS:
Right. But you have to take a look at the risks. I mean, look at the risks that the insurance companies are taking. And the banks, of course, are financing these homes. And now you can't get insurance on them, so all of a sudden you can't rebuild. I mean, these are risks that the banks are looking at.


JEROME POWELL:
So, we don't -- we don't regulate insurance companies.


JUAN VARGAS:
No. Right. But you regulate the banks.


JEROME POWELL:
Banks, yeah.


JUAN VARGAS:
And these banks have mortgages on those insurance -- on those -- the houses, do they not, many of them?


JEROME POWELL:
Well, in many cases, they're -- they're -- they're not writing mortgages anymore. So, that's -- that's the result we're getting, is that banks are saying -- you know, they see these risks. They do.


JUAN VARGAS:
Thank you. My time's up. But thank you again. Appreciate you.


JEROME POWELL:
Thank you.


PATRICK MCHENRY:
The gentlelady from California, Ms. Kim, is recognized for five minutes.


YOUNG KIM:
Thank you, Chairman. Chairman Powell, thank you for being with us today. Gosh, you're under a lot of pressure from all sides to diverge from our monetary policy goals. And I commend you for your leadership and staying focused on the core missions of the Fed, which are price stability and maximum employment.

So, thanks again for your leadership. And you have stated that it is the Fed's strong view that you will have to reopen the Basel III endgame proposal for comment again. And I really urge FDIC and OCC moving forward with reopening the comment -- the comment period. Chairman Powell, would broad support mean abandonment of -- abandonment of any modified proposal that garners mostly negative public comments in a public comment period for the modified proposal?


JEROME POWELL:
Sorry. I didn't follow your question.


YOUNG KIM:
Would broad support mean abandonment of any modified proposal that garners mostly negative public comments in a public comment period for the modified proposal?


JEROME POWELL:
Broad support and -- empirically would mean, you know, a good solid vote on the Fed board. And I have -- I've tried not to be specific about what that means. But it means -- it also means broad support among the -- the broader community of -- of commenters on -- on all sides. That's what -- that's what I meant by broad support.


YOUNG KIM:
Got it.


JEROME POWELL:
Yeah, that's what I meant by it.


YOUNG KIM:
Thank you. And as the Fed looks to enacting several changes to the proposal, I would also urge you not to overlook how the Basel end -- endgame proposal would disproportionately impact FBOs and regional banks and US domestic jobs because of the way the outside operational risk is, you know, weighted. So, can we get your commitment to that?


JEROME POWELL:
So, we're -- let me just say we're -- I'm not going to get into specifics. We're well aware of those concerns. You know, we've -- we're -- we've obviously carefully digested all of the comments we've gotten from all different sectors, and those -- those are concerns that we're well aware of.


YOUNG KIM:
Thank you. Let's switch gear to another matter. You have spoken for the need of transparency. Are there any conversations at the Fed to have more transparency and better engagement and consistency with stress tests?


JEROME POWELL:
So, we -- you know, we -- we have increased transparency in the stress tests over time. And I would say, you know, we -- we do -- if people want to write articles and make comments that are critical to the stress test, we're going to read those and we're going to think about that. We're open to improving it. We know that we -- that the stress test has to evolve over time if it's to remain relevant.

And I think transparency is one of those subjects where we're -- you know, we're prepared to listen and -- and think about ideas.


YOUNG KIM:
Yeah, definitely. I would like to see more -- a stress test regime that is more transparent and adapted, identifying unforeseen risks so we can achieve that by being more collaborative, I believe, yes. So, I'm also interested to hear from you whether you and your fellow banking regulators have considered the cumulative impact of any new liquidity standards with the Basel III framework and the existing post-crisis liquidity requirements.

So, what industry engagement has the board staff held with respect to changes to the liquidity framework?


JEROME POWELL:
So, we haven't actually made any proposals on that yet. We have had significant industry interaction on the -- on the proposals. And, I mean, we're -- we're -- we will move, I think, at some time this year for --


YOUNG KIM:
What about the -- the board staff? Have they conducted any industrywide data collection to study the necessity for and the impact of any changes to the existing liquidity framework?




JEROME POWELL:
I think we've done a lot of investigation on that front. But I think that this is the beginning of the process, not the end. You know, we'll -- we haven't published proposals yet. We're -- we're, you know, working on them, and it's a pretty early stage.


YOUNG KIM:
Thank you. Let me quickly talk about the inflation issue. We had a peak inflation rate of 9.1 percent in June 2022. And a lot has been talked about it being a supply side issue and the demand shock from the opening economy. So, can you elaborate how the expansion in the money supply and fiscal stimulus played a role in persistent inflation?

And why is it so important to get to the 2 percent inflation rate goal right now?


JEROME POWELL:
So, the -- the inflation that arose here was a collision between very strong demand as the economy reopened. Remember that there had been fiscal transfers. We had rates very low. You know, those things were done because we -- we thought we could be looking at a very, very bad economic time. As it turns out, the economy reopened and demand spiked very high.

People had saved a lot of money because they couldn't spend. And so, there was tremendous demand and there was constrained supply. And what you got was inflation, and you got that everywhere in the world. That's what happened. So, what's happened to bring inflation down, we've made quite a lot of progress on inflation.

To bring inflation down, the Fed has been working on -- with restrictive policy, on cooling demand. That has been working. And the supply side has been healing. And, you know, the -- the negative labor participation shock has essentially reversed adjusted for inflation.


PATRICK MCHENRY:
The gentlelady's time --


JEROME POWELL:
So, it's kind of working out as we had expected.


YOUNG KIM:
Thank you very much, Chairman.


PATRICK MCHENRY:
The gentlewoman from Georgia, Ms. Williams, is now recognized for five minutes.


NIKEMA WILLIAMS:
Thank you, Chairman McHenry. And thank you, Chair Powell, for joining us today. As the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, Raphael Bostic has so rightly pointed out that combating economic inequality is a critical part of the Fed's dual mandate. When everyone in our community doesn't have the opportunity to contribute to their fullest potential, the economy is not firing on all cylinders.

Nowhere is this more apparent than in my home city of Atlanta, which has more black owned businesses than any other city in the country, but is still among our nation's leaders in the racial wealth gap. I applaud you and your staff at the Federal Reserve for the work that you're doing to make sure that the economy works as well for the hard-working people of Georgia's fighting 5th District as it does for those in the top 1 percent.

This includes helping to make sure that financial services are affordable and accessible to everyone. As the Fed moves forward with the proposed changes to Regulation II, I know that protecting access to affordable and accessible banking is at the top of your mind. That is why I was concerned when I started receiving outreach about the unintentional effects that Reg II proposed rule would have on marginalized communities, including my constituents in Atlanta.

Specifically, I heard about the impact that the reduction in interchange fees proposed by this rule could have on bank owned certified accounts in my district and across the country. The bank owned initiative is a partnership between financial institutions and trusted community based organizations to offer low or no cost bank accounts to unbanked and underbanked individuals.

Access and affordability are at the heart of the changes that you're proposing, and I couldn't agree more with those goals. But we have to make sure that programs designed to serve unbanked and underbanked individuals in marginalized communities continue to flourish. In response to these concerns, my colleague across the aisle, Mr. Luetkemeyer and I sent a bipartisan comment letter in March to you highlighting those very concerns and urging that the final rule not negatively impact low and moderate income communities.

Chair Powell, how does the Fed take into account how regulations impact constituents who don't have an attorney or an interest group to submit a comment on their behalf?


JEROME POWELL:
Well, let me say first we -- you know, we have heard those concerns that you raise and others have raised about aspects of the proposed rule. And, you know, we very much understand the concerns that are being raised. In terms of people who -- where we don't have comment letters, you know, we -- we -- I mean, we try to be thoughtful about the impact of our regulations.

But principally, we're looking for public comment on -- on things.


NIKEMA WILLIAMS:
Thank you. The FDIC'S most recent data shows that the rate of unbanked households is at an all time low. The bank owned initiative has certainly played an important role in this progress. Bank owned certified accounts are available to more than 95 percent of low and moderate income households across all 50 states.

Access to low or no cost banking services is a -- is a door to financial inclusion and wealth generation for marginalized families. As written, Reg II could undo some of those -- some of the enormous progress made in the past several years. Chair Powell, how can regulators work with members of this committee to ensure that future proposed rules do not hinder Americans' access to tools that enhance the Federal Reserve's financial inclusion efforts?


JEROME POWELL:
So, we're -- we're very focused on things like bank owned, as you pointed out, and on -- on, you know, access to the financial system for marginalized communities. And we wouldn't want to do anything to -- to weigh on that. And -- and we -- we're happy to work with you and your office on -- on -- on that -- on those issues.

But we're -- so, you know, as I mentioned, we're -- we're hearing the comments and we're reading them. And we're -- you know, we're taking those into account as we think about appropriate changes to the proposal.


NIKEMA WILLIAMS:
So, we will definitely follow up on that because, as we're writing these regulations, I want to make sure that -- that we're thinking about the real world impact and what it means to consumers when they're accessing financial institutions. I look forward to working with you to further the Fed's financial inclusion efforts.

Like, earlier this week, I sent you another bipartisan letter related to the Federal Reserve's April propose -- proposal to extend the operating hours of Fedwire Funds Service to 22 hours per day, seven days per week and every day of the year. That was news that I was eager to hear. This may sound like a small technical change, but it can have a big impact on our constituents, especially for those living in marginalized communities who live paycheck to paycheck.

Growing up in the booming metropolis of Smiths Station, Alabama, probably never heard of it, Chair Powell, but there are limited options for loans and short term loans. In an area where everyone needs a car to get to work and they have to work to eat, when money is short, any delay in accessing a paycheck or paying a bill can disrupt your entire household.

Extending operating hours for Fedwire Funds Service and National Settlement Service will allow people continual access to their funds outside of what we deem normal operating hours. And I hear the gavel. I'm out of time, but we will be following up for more conversation. Thank you.


JEROME POWELL:
Thank you.


PATRICK MCHENRY:
The gentleman from Nebraska, Mr. Flood, is recognized for five minutes.


MIKE FLOOD:
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Powell, after a year with very high inflation that battered American paychecks, inflation rates have moderated some. However, inflation continues to linger above the 2 percent target rate set by the Federal Reserve. In fact, the PCE inflation index has remained above 2 percent for the last three years.

The Federal Open Market Committee Statement on Longer Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy issued at the beginning of the year stated, "The committee seeks to achieve inflation that averages 2 percent over time and therefore judges that, following periods when inflation has been running persistently below 2 percent, appropriate monetary policy will likely aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time." Chairman Powell, does the commitment to achieve a 2 percent average over time apply in the other direction as well?

Meaning that, if inflation remains above 2 percent for a protracted period, would the committee instead aim for inflation moderately below 2 percent for some time in order to achieve an inflation average of 2 percent?


JEROME POWELL:
No, it doesn't.


MIKE FLOOD:
Is it fair to say that you would need to see the PCE index dip below 2 percent at least once in the coming months in order to contemplate a rate cut?


JEROME POWELL:
No, that's not fair to say. We -- we've said that you -- you don't want to wait until inflation gets all the way down to 2 percent, because inflation has a certain momentum. You wouldn't -- you wouldn't wait that long. If you -- if you waited that long, you've probably waited too long because inflation will be moving downward and will go well below 2 percent, which we don't want.


MIKE FLOOD:
What combination of factors would you need to see in order to support a rate cut this month or in September?


JEROME POWELL:
So, I'm -- once again, I'm -- I'll say I'm not sending any signals on any particular date of any meeting whatsoever on policy. I said that yesterday and I'm saying it again today. But I will answer your question. So, what we've said is that we want to be more confident. We want to have greater confidence, and that means more good inflation readings that inflation is moving sustainably down to 2 percent, greater confidence that that is the case.

But remember, we have a dual mandate, too. We're not just an inflation targeting central bank. We -- we also have an employment mandate. So, I -- I could also see us cutting, and we've said this, I've said this, if we saw unexpected weakening in the labor market. And we do now see -- I -- I'll speak for myself.

I now see the -- the risks to the two mandates as much closer to being in balance. I think for a long time we've had to focus heavily on the inflation mandate. But I think now we're getting to the place where -- where, you know, your -- your -- the -- the labor market is -- is getting pretty much in balance to where it needs to be. And -- and so, we're looking at both sides.


MIKE FLOOD:
I know that the media and others have continued to talk about the prospect of political interference with the Federal Reserve. With an election coming up, I know you are very aware of the heightened scrutiny awaiting the Open Market Committee meetings in July and September. Can you use this opportunity to speak regarding the Federal Reserve's political independence going into this election?


JEROME POWELL:
Sure, I'd be glad to. So, you know, our political independence is -- is critical to our ability to -- to do our jobs and -- and to sustain the faith of people across the political spectrum. And it comes down to we make our decisions based on economic data, the evolving outlook, the balance of risks, and we don't take into consideration other -- any other factors, including political factors.

We have a long history of -- of -- of doing that, and I think the public believes we will do that. Any decision that we make to -- you know, on rates, on -- on any of our policy tools, it's going to be very well-grounded in the data, and it will represent our best thinking about what is best for the American public in the near and medium term.

And that's the -- that's the promise that I will give and that all my colleagues will give. And that means we're -- we're not looking at things like election cycles. We're not looking at -- at any of those things. We're looking at the data, what does it tell us is the right thing to do. When we figure that out, when we think it's time to move we go ahead and move, but not until then.


MIKE FLOOD:
Appreciate that. Finally, I'd like to raise concerns with housing costs. While shelter is one component of the broader PCE calculation, housing often makes up one of the largest, if not the largest, expense for many consumers. Inflation for housing remains persistently high. One of the characteristics of this economy is that consumer -- consumer sentiment is remarkably low.

Do you think high housing costs could be contributing to the persistently low consumer sentiment?


JEROME POWELL:
I think prices -- high prices generally. I think nobody really has a -- can be super highly confident of their -- of their answer on this. But I do think it's the fact that, while inflation has come down, prices are high, if you know what I mean, and -- and people are paying more for things, more for housing, more for the essentials of life, food, energy.

And, you know, that -- that to me is -- is how I would explain surveys. We say that the economy is growing, inflation's come down, unemployment's low. And all that's true, but prices are high.


MIKE FLOOD:
Thank you, Chairman Powell, for your answer and your testimony. And I yield back.


PATRICK MCHENRY:
The gentleman from New York, Mr. Torres, is recognized for five minutes.


RITCHIE TORRES:
Thank you. Chair Powell, the Fed has an inflation rate target of 2 percent. Are you waiting for both PCE inflation and CPI inflation to fall to 2 percent, or only one of those metrics?


JEROME POWELL:
So, we -- we look at different measures. But for a quarter of a century, the PCE inflation has been the Fed's goal. We've defined our goal in terms of that because we think it's -- it's the better measure of the -- of the costs and inflation that the public actually faces.


RITCHIE TORRES:
And now, you've said that you're willing to cut interest rates before reaching the 2 percent target. Is the decision to cut interest rates going to be driven by reaching a particular target en route to 2 percent, or is it driven by the overall trajectory of the inflation rate?


JEROME POWELL:
It's -- it's going to be driven by the totality of the data. There isn't a -- there isn't a particular number that we have in mind that we have to get to. It's more -- we look at all of the data, and the question we're asking ourselves is are we sufficiently confident that inflation really is moving down toward 2 percent?

So, what's the underlying inflation rate looking through the volatility. We're also looking, though, as I mentioned, at -- at the labor market. And we're asking ourselves, you know, we -- we have to take into account now maximum employment, that mandate. So, we're looking at both of those in the decisions that we make.


RITCHIE TORRES:
I mean, are you confident that the inflation rate is on a downward trajectory?


JEROME POWELL:
I -- I do have some confidence of that. I think we've seen that over the past several years. The question is are we sufficiently confident that it is moving sustainably down to 2 percent, and I'm not prepared to say that yet.


RITCHIE TORRES:
Chair Powell, you announced a re-proposal of Basel III rather than a mere revision. Do you believe that the US banking system is sufficiently capitalized in the absence of Basel III?


JEROME POWELL:
I -- I've long been of the view that US -- that US banks are well capitalized and that the level of capital in the US banking system is -- is about right.


RITCHIE TORRES:
Okay. So, if the banking system is sufficiently capitalized in the absence of Basel III, then what exactly is the need for Basel III?


JEROME POWELL:
I think, first of all, there's -- there's no precise answer as to the appropriate level of capital. I think we -- we've been part of developing the Basel standards. They create international broad parity. It's -- it's important that we have that. It's important that we -- that we do something that is comparable to what the other large jurisdictions are doing and that it's consistent with Basel.

And I think that's -- that's what our banks want, that's what we want, and that's -- that will be best serving the public.


RITCHIE TORRES:
But you agree we should conform without gold plating.


JEROME POWELL:
You know, we -- some -- some things we've gold plated and some things we haven't. And -- but I think -- I think we should make -- I think our endgame proposal should be -- at the end should be consistent with the requirements of Basel and -- and consistent with what the other large jurisdictions are doing.


RITCHIE TORRES:
Are you confident that there's no legal conflict between the standardization recommended by Basel III and the regulatory tailoring mandated by Congress?


JEROME POWELL:
I think we can work through all that.


RITCHIE TORRES:
Okay, but if there were a conflict with --


JEROME POWELL:
-- Basel -- Basel doesn't impose any requirements on anyone, there's no enforceable requirements. Every jurisdiction does. What it's going to do. Basel is -- is doesn't bind anybody.


RITCHIE TORRES:
Right, but the regulatory framework you're adopting would codify those recommendations, yes, which would have the force of law, right?


JEROME POWELL:
Yes, that's right.


RITCHIE TORRES:
And so if there were a conflict between the codified recommendations and an act of Congress, would you agree that an act of Congress would supersede those recommendations?


JEROME POWELL:
Yes. Sure.


RITCHIE TORRES:
Does the loss of Chevron deference have any implications for Basel III?


JEROME POWELL:
You know, the -- it's very early days to, to -- to assess there are several decisions that that are about administrative law and I think it's too early for us to say. I mean, ultimately the question is, are the actions we're taking in compliance with the law and that that decision says that there will be a less deference or no deference maybe to the opinions of the agency.

But that just means a court will be making -- they're answering the same question, which is, are those actions consistent with -- with the law.


RITCHIE TORRES:
The Fed has a target rate when it comes to inflation. Does the fed have a target when it comes to quantitative tightening like when it comes to what should be the size of the Fed's balance sheet?


JEROME POWELL:
Well, we have a -- we don't have a specific target, no.


RITCHIE TORRES:
What would you consider to be a healthy size for the Fed?


JEROME POWELL:
We define it, um, you know, with not with numbers but with words and we, you know, we want an ample reserves regime with a buffer so that -- so that reserves are -- are not scarce and we think plentiful reserves, ample reserves is the right place to be. And you know, we'll find that empirically.


RITCHIE TORRES:
Can you put a number on that?


JEROME POWELL:
No, I can't really.


RITCHIE TORRES:
Uh, for -- for decades, we've had the best of both worlds, low unemployment and low inflation. Can the US economy return to the golden age of low unemployment and low inflation or are we doomed to live with a new normal of higher interest rates?


JEROME POWELL:
Well, I -- you know, I think we have low inflation, we've got a period here of very low -- I'm sorry of low -- low -- low unemployment.


RITCHIE TORRES:
We have high inflation. Co can we have the best of both worlds?


JEROME POWELL:
We certainly can and that's the plan. We will -- we're going to return to 2 percent inflation. I'm reasonably confident. We -- some people argue that we're entering into a world of a lot of upward inflation shocks that would be a challenging world. But, you know, that remains to be seen.


RITCHIE TORRES:
Thank you.


PATRICK MCHENRY:
Gentleman from Iowa, Mr. Nunn is recognized for five minutes.


ZACH NUNN:
Thank you, Mr. Chair.


JEROME POWELL:
And thank you Chairman Powell for being with us today. Your office has done a very diligent job in working with this body on both sides of the aisle. I chalk some of that up to the fact that you've got some very good folks from Iowa on your staff there, helping keep the trains running on time. So that's excellent.

I will note that you know, in Iowa the average family has experienced, you know, annual inflation of about $925 per month just in the last three years. I've got six kids where the number one egg producing state in the country, but yet eggs for each one of my kids goes up 40 percent this past year and take that time six.

I'm no economist, but that adds up real quick and I think I'm reflective of a lot of families across the country right now.


ZACH NUNN:
So, Mr. Chair, one of the things I'd like to talk about is, um, you know what we are focused on and what your department's working on at the Fed. The US Federal Reserve in my opinion should be more focused on folks like my hometown of Bondurant, Iowa versus what's coming out of unelected bureaucrats in Brussels, Belgium for example, which is one of the reasons I'm so grateful that you have talked about reopening Basel III for a conversation on what's in the best interest of the American people.

I applaud you and your team for this. While I would like to see Basel III candidly scrapped all together. I think that there are three things in this proposal that we've got to look at immediately. One, the impact of credit availability, especially to ensure that it won't be tighter credit conditions on small businesses, back home in places like Iowa, the ability for farmers across the country to be able to hedge their grain, corn, soybean livestock in a new Basel III conversation.

And ultimately eliminate the downstream effects on American banks being held to higher standards and very clear in Basel III and what's being held in Europe. So with that, I want to readdress your team's attention to the letter I sent in a bipartisan way with Senator Jerry Moran, specifically emphasizing the negative impact of increased bank capital requirements on the economy, our constituents and ultimately our ag producers across the country.

So what I'll first say is can you confirm that the next Basel III proposal as outlined will address concerns from our ag growers, including our farmers?


JEROME POWELL:
Let me just say that we're well aware of the concerns you're raising about hedging and I'm not going to be too specific about things, but we're quite aware of those concerns.


ZACH NUNN:
I certainly hope your team gets the opportunity to hear that because it's one of the most painful things I'm hearing back in my home district. Would you agree that the end users concerns could have been mitigated maybe at the front end of this if, you know, uh, Congress or say a farmer in my district had been included in those opening conversations?


JEROME POWELL:
Um, you know, in hindsight perhaps that's right, but in any case this is what the comment period is for.


ZACH NUNN:
Well, I'll note that 84 percent of the comments coming from uh, this proposal concerned entities outside of banks. As you know, a lot of those were from the ag industry who felt that they had no voice in this and were a recipient of things that really harm their businesses. With that, I want to read quickly former Treasury secretary, Larry Summers, was asked about Basel and he said, quote, we're going to need to prepare for consolidation in banking in the future, quite possibly some even further evolution of lending away from banks.

Now I'm going to note here that Iowa has over 250 community banks with assets under $7 billion. His commitment -- or his comments are of great concern on this consolidation. Do you share concerns about a consolidation amongst banks across America?


JEROME POWELL:
So you know, we all I speak for myself, you know, I realize that community banks are tremendously important in their communities and -- and it's not a better world when when community banks go out of business or at the same time if there needs to be consolidation, I don't think we should be standing in the way of that.

But we shouldn't -- We don't want to be part of the reason why community banks are -- are going out of business or being forced to merge because of, for example, high-fixed costs because of regulation or other things.


ZACH NUNN:
I would agree with you, Mr. Chairman. We don't want to be the instigator for a small bank to have to go out and stop serving a local community. You know, as we look at Basel III, if it's finalized in early 2025, does that mean we will push implementation back to 2026?


JEROME POWELL:
I don't know exactly what it would be, but that's something like that is right. You know, we'd have a -- we'd have a typical phase in process at the end of the, you know, quite a lot of work to do to get to a final rule. And then there'll be a phase in process. I don't know exactly what the date would be.


ZACH NUNN:
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I just want to know kind of a timeline for my folks. I mean there's obviously 2026 or take my advice, scrap it all together and we can start over if we even need to do that. Let me ask very quickly with Chevron overturned, is there anything your, uh, the Fed is doing to identify areas where maybe we have overregulated at the federal side and you're self-policing right now?


JEROME POWELL:
Under the Chevron decision, I mean, again, our view is we're -- we're very focused on -- on obeying the law and reading, reading the actual words of the law and interpreting it according to the words that are in the law. This is the way we approach things. And -- and I am not sure how much will change. You know, basically a court will be doing that with a little bit less deference to -- to the agency, but you know we -- we think we're already interpreting the law pretty carefully.

So and again this -- these are brand new decisions. There are several of them and I it's way early. We're just studying them now.


ZACH NUNN:
Thank you, Chairman Powell. Thank you, Chair, and I hope you continue to self-police. It's much appreciated to you and your team.


PATRICK MCHENRY:
We'll now recognize the gentleman from North Carolina, my friend, Mr. Nickel for five minutes.


WILEY NICKEL:
Thank you so much, Mr. Chairman. Welcome back, Chair Powell. I represent a Republican-leaning, very purple district, so my constituents sent me here to -- to get things done. It's been disappointing that we're on track for what I believe could be the least productive Congress in our nation's history. But this committee has done some good bipartisan work on digital -- the digital assets, market structure, bill and stablecoins.

It's a place where I have hope that we're going to see some action in this Congress. I know you and I have privately spoken about stablecoins and, you know, here in the House in a bipartisan way, we've been working diligently to pass a bill to regulate payment stablecoins. This committee voted in favor of the legislation in a bipartisan way last year and there have been numerous calls from this committee to -- to -- to you and -- and to the Fed asking that you prioritize working with Congress to help push this legislation forward.

We've enjoyed our conversations with staff as well. Um, can you commit to directing your staff to finalize and support passage of stablecoin legislation this year?


JEROME POWELL:
So we've been, you know, really pleased to take part in this process and you know very much appreciate being included in it and we'll -- we'll -- we'll stay with it. You know, we think it's really important that there -- that we have a federal framework for stablecoins and again we'll be -- we'll be all in on -- on working with you to get that done.


WILEY NICKEL:
Thank you very much. Uh, big issue for -- for the folks that I represent housing, housing, the rising cost of housing hits my constituents, especially hard in North Carolina. Uh, our ranking member, Maxine Waters, has made this a big priority for the work that we do in the committee. In North Carolina. We've got 343,000 households that spend over half of their monthly income on rent, leaving little to little money for other expenses like health care, transportation and food.

Uh, access to safe and affordable housing is essential to the well-being of working families and individuals in North Carolina and around the country. Chair Powell, despite the strong economic trends you mentioned in your testimony, housing prices and median rents have increased by nearly 50 and 41 percent respectively since May of 2020 and they continue to rise.

In fact, housing costs continue to outpace modest wage gains. Um, high-interest rates continue to add to those costs. For example, high interest rates make it more expensive for home builders to finance new housing. High-interest rates also cause landlords to change higher rents and lead to higher mortgage costs for would be homebuyers.

I know that you and your colleagues at the Fed are correctly focused on bringing down inflation an important goal, but have you considered that at this point with housing cost increases being the primary driver of inflation keeping interest rates high, only thwarts that stated goal?


JEROME POWELL:
So, um, a couple of things are happening with housing there before the pandemic, there was uh, you know, pretty serious housing shortage and we can't do anything about that. Uh, then the pandemic comes along and, you know, we really think the best thing, the most important thing we can do for the housing market in the -- in the medium and longer term is to get inflation under control so that interest rates can come down.

So that we can -- we can get back to a more normal interest rate. We don't -- no one knows exactly where interest rates will go, but they'll be lower than they are now. And the housing market supply and demand will work their way out and you'll have -- you'll have supply of housing. Um, there's still going to be a housing shortage at the end of that though and uh, you know, it's true that um, our policies work through interest-sensitive spending.

Housing is maybe the most interest-sensitive form of spending, buying housing houses on, on with a mortgage. And we know that we have really significant effects in that market and it's tough on people. But this is the path to getting inflation down, which will bear fruit for for many, many years.


WILEY NICKEL:
Thanks so much. I don't think I'm going to be able to get in my next question in the limited time I have. But I wanted to give you this opportunity if you'd like it. I've talked to you privately about this and a pretty good idea of what you'll say, but if you would like to say that the economy is heading for a soft landing, you're welcome to to say soft landing as -- as much as you'd like right now.


JEROME POWELL:
I'll say as I -- for some time, I've thought there is a path to getting to back to full-price stability without -- while keeping the inflation -- sorry, the unemployment rate low there is that path. We've been on it. We're very, very focused on staying on that path. I would say we're at a place now where the risks to the two mandates are much more in balance than they were.

And that means it's not just about getting inflation down, the job is not done on inflation. We have more work to do there. But at the same time, we need to be mindful of where the labor market is and we have seen considerable softening in the labor market. We still have a strong labor market with low unemployment.

By all means, but so this is -- this is what we are very focused on, on, on continuing to, to work toward.


WILEY NICKEL:
Thank you very much and I yield.


ANDY BARR:
The gentlewoman from Texas, Ms. De la Cruz, is now recognized.


MONICA DE LA CRUZ:
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you, Chair Powell, for being here today. I appreciate that. I represent a working class in South Texas. In fact, my district is mostly Hispanic, one of the most Hispanic districts in the entire nation over 80 percent. And my district is also a rural community so the topic today greatly affects my constituents and is something personal for me. That being said, um, the population that I represent is a population that the Federal Reserve research has shown disproportionately will be the hardest hit in inflation.

That being said, higher prices due to Biden's induced inflation is something not only the nation is feeling, but my constituents are feeling. They're feeling it at the grocery store. They're feeling it at the gas pump. Small businesses are feeling this and we know that cutting back on their spending, people who are living paycheck to paycheck, they still can't get away from these increasing costs at the grocery store or the gas station.



MONICA DE LA CRUZ:
So even small changes have a big impact in rural communities like mine. In fact the Farm Bureau recently said that the cost of the 4th of July prices -- the 4th of July celebration had high, high increases. The headline reads record high 4th of July cookout costs, inflation hits the backyard. This report says that costs were up 5 percent from last year and up 30 percent from just a few years ago, all during the Biden administration time.

Now the Biden administration wants us to simply forget about the last three years and the pain it has caused families in my district. They don't understand why people are unhappy about their current economic situation. And quite frankly, it is angering, and it's simply out of touch with the everyday American.

It seems obvious that, until we grapple with the runaway government spending, that unfortunately we are going to continue to have runaway inflation. Chairman Powell, can you explain to us how the excessive government spending not only increases the national debt but also affects inflation as well?


JEROME POWELL:
Sure. So, let me say, first of all, we completely understand that inflation hurts people -- you know, low and moderate income people directly and immediately in a way that it doesn't affect even -- even middle class people, because, you know, the -- paying more for the -- the necessities of life when you don't have much of a financial safety net, the -- the pain starts right away.

We get that. And so, it is for those people, among others, that we are doing everything we can to get inflation under control and -- and stay at the job until it's done. In terms of the causes of inflation, you know, the inflation that we're having is not that different from what other advanced economies around the world are having.

And it really results from the -- you know, the pandemic comes along -- inflation is low. The pandemic comes along. We shut down the economy. People are -- they're sent checks to replace their income. They can't spend that money because they can't -- they can't go to the movie theater or to a football game because everything is closed.

So, savings go up. And so, people are spending a lot. Meanwhile --


MONICA DE LA CRUZ:
Chair Powell -- Chair Powell, I have only a minute left, so I yield my time back. I want to shift gears real quickly. I continue to believe that the federal banking agencies, including the Fed, should scrap the flawed Basel III endgame proposal and start over. At this point, the last thing a first time home buyer, a small business owner and constituents -- as you said, low income people who are rural people, for example in my community, the last thing they need is harder access to capital, which is exactly what that proposal does.

The public knows it and doesn't want it either, with a whopping 97 percent of public comments being negative for this proposal. Chair Powell, don't you agree that, with the overwhelming negative reception of this proposal, that it shows a lack of public support?


JEROME POWELL:
I do think that's fair to say.


MONICA DE LA CRUZ:
Thank you. I yield back.


ANDY BARR:
The gentlewoman from Colorado, Ms. Pettersen, is now recognized.


BRITTANY PETTERSEN:
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thank you for your service in such difficult times. We sign up to serve and we don't know what's going to come our way. When I think about what we've been through as a country, with a global pandemic, the economy in collapse and what this Congress was able to do to infuse money to keep our small businesses afloat, critical services available and making sure that we were in a position for the quickest strongest recovery in the world.

And while we have a lot to feel proud of, we recognize and have had many conversations throughout this committee about the pain points that people are continuing to feel with rising costs. And you touched on this. I really appreciate the discussion around housing in an earlier question because this is the greatest inflationary cost, especially in Colorado, where we have seen significant home price increases, a lack of supply.

People are unable to move because they -- they would go to a much higher interest rate, and then people are unable to buy because they can't afford those mortgage payments. And so, while you've talked about recognizing that lowering the interest rates will actually help with addressing the housing crisis, it's -- we still have a lack of housing supply.

So, can you talk a little bit more about what's happening and that -- you know, that lower interest rates are only a piece of this?


JEROME POWELL:
It's a -- it's a longer term thing. And a lot of it is it's harder to get lots and zoning and materials and workers. And in many, many metropolitan areas, the -- the -- the near-in areas are all built up. If you look around Washington -- I grew up near Washington DC, and, you know, it was countryside just a couple of miles outside the Beltway.

There was no Beltway when I was born. But ultimately, it's just -- we -- we have not enough housing. And that was true before the pandemic, and certainly the pandemic did slow down housing construction. I think we'll get back to a more normal economy with lower interest rates and -- and those sorts of things.

But we're still going to have a, you know, housing shortage.


BRITTANY PETTERSEN:
Absolutely. When I think about the other pieces of the fallout from the global pandemic and the changes that we saw in our economy was in commercial real estate. And I've continued to read about regional bank failures and the risks that the commercial real estate poses in the long term for those assets being on the books for banks.

What do you -- what is your insight on the risk that it poses for financial stability and what we should be thinking about here in Congress?


JEROME POWELL:
So, the -- the commercial real estate situation, which is -- you know, it's -- it's significantly downtown office and related retail and things like that. This is -- this is something that banks have been working their way through for the last couple of -- couple of years. I think it'll take more time, more years to work all the way through it. We know from the stress tests and from our own work that -- that the large bank, they're -- they're going to be okay here.

Some of the regional banks and smaller banks have what you would expect, which is high concentrations in their local community in real estate. We are aware of those. The banks are aware of it. I think the supervisors are -- are -- have been around those banks making sure they have capital, they have liquidity, they have a reasonably -- you know, not too optimistic assessment of how much capital they'll need, how big the losses will be. So, I think we'll be working through this.

And I -- you know, it's -- it doesn't seem to be a systemic problem or one that threatens the broader financial stability. It does threaten bank profitability and -- and those sorts of things. But -- and it'll be with us a while. We'll just keep working our way through it.


BRITTANY PETTERSEN:
And the ability to continue to loan to small businesses --


JEROME POWELL:
Yeah.


BRITTANY PETTERSEN:
Because you're being locked up. I -- you are not going to have enough time to answer this question. But my remaining outstanding question is around the recent Chevron ruling and, you know, how you anticipate that impacting the Fed's ability to adjust to -- to the needs of the country and ensure financial stability without being sued at every turn.


JEROME POWELL:
You know, we're -- we're just looking at all these new decisions. So -- and it's earliest day. I speak under the control of my general counsel, who -- I don't want to cause him to strike me.


BRITTANY PETTERSEN:
That's how I feel about my staff, I mean, not striking me.


JEROME POWELL:
No. But, I mean, look, ultimately we -- we're already doing -- we're already very careful at the Fed about -- about keeping within the law. We're really committed to that value, and -- and, you know, this ruling doesn't change that. And -- and I think we'll -- we'll continue to be an institution that's strongly committed to the rule of law.


BRITTANY PETTERSEN:
Great. Thank you so much. I yield back.


JEROME POWELL:
Thank you.


ANDY BARR:
Gentlelady yields. The gentleman from Wisconsin, Mr. Fitzgerald, is recognized.


SCOTT FITZGERALD:
Chairman, thanks for being here. There has been a lot of talk about Basel III. Wanted to just change that subject a little bit. Long term debt proposal I think should be rewritten and re-proposed as well. But at the very least, the rule needs to be tailored as the law requires so that regional banks aren't treated more harshly than the largest banks, of course.

In particular, the requirement for regional banks to hold long term debt at both the holding company and insured depository institution, that seems to be a burden is what we're hearing, I think. I just wanted to mention that -- that I would hope that there would be some flexibility for smaller regional banks to pre-position resources because they're obviously -- there -- there's some resources that are loss -- I don't know, loss absorbing, I guess is the way you would consider them in the re-proposal.

Do you have any thoughts on kind of how this is playing out right now or what this looks like?


JEROME POWELL:
Yeah. So, on the -- on the long term debt thing, you know, we put it out for -- for comment. We've received quite a few comments and we're -- you know, we're -- staff has been analyzing them. And -- and, you know, we're -- that's something where we're well aware of the concerns that have been raised and we're thinking carefully about how to move forward on that.

The other one was um pre-positioning. That -- that that's more along the lines of the discount window and the liquidity requirements, I take it. So --


SCOTT FITZGERALD:
Right.


JEROME POWELL:
So, you know, we haven't made a proposal there yet. We're thinking carefully about that. You know, we -- I think we -- we're trying to learn the right lessons from what happened last spring at Silicon Valley Bank and a couple other banks. And one of them just is the discount window worked, but we could certainly modernize it and make it more effective.

And also, we learned, you know, that -- that bank runs are moving just a whole lot faster, at least in that case, and that the speed even -- even bank runs from 10 or 15 years ago were -- were nothing like as fast as what happened in Silicon Valley. So, we need to -- we need to bake that -- that new learning into the liquidity requirements in some way or other.

We, again, haven't made a proposal. When we do, of course, it'll go out for comment. And we'll -- we'll -- we'll very much want to learn from -- from -- from those comments.


SCOTT FITZGERALD:
Very good. There's been a clear trend of banks stepping away from the mortgage market kind of in the face of the increased regulation. That's my interpretation at least. Non-bank lenders have stepped in to kind of fill that void. Today banks support the non-bank lenders and the broader housing finance system through the so-called -- the warehouse lending for home mortgages.

But I'm -- I'm deeply concerned that some of the -- as was mentioned by my colleagues earlier, that some of the Basel rules will -- could harm both bank and non-bank lenders alike, kind of undermining the liquidity and -- and kind of the raising costs of -- of home buyers. So, let me just ask, in regards to Basel III, the end game proposal, could it make housing finance less stable, I guess is the question?


JEROME POWELL:
That's certainly not the intention. And, you know, we're, again, well aware of the -- of the concerns that have been raised and, you know, certainly paying careful attention to those.


SCOTT FITZGERALD:
Despite the smaller issuer exemption for the debit -- for debit interchange fee cap, issuers with less than $10 billion of assets reportedly lost about 35 percent of inflation adjusted interchange revenue. Have you considered the impact a further reduction of debt interchange will have on small financial institutions with less than $10 billion of assets?


JEROME POWELL:
Yes. So, we're -- that's another one where we put out a proposal. We got a lot of comments and we're carefully reviewing those. And we're certainly -- we're certainly aware of the specific concern that you raised.


SCOTT FITZGERALD:
As you may know, the latest Fed Y-14 proposal, which is used to help collect data for Fed stress tests, asks banks for more detailed data on bank lending to non-banks. You know, as a result, there's concern that the Fed may start trying to indirectly regulate non-banks in the financial risk. I just talked to one this morning that's -- that's concerned about that.

So, given those concerns raised about the lack of transparency in its stress testing models and the potential unintended consequences, is the Fed planning to indirectly regulate non-bank financial institutions through these tests?


JEROME POWELL:
That's -- that's not the idea. The idea is we -- you know, we see intermediation growing very quickly in non-banks. And, you know, we don't regulate them. We're not -- we're don't have a secret plan to regulate them or anything like that. It is -- but the question is what -- what risks are being kept inside the banking system, which we do regulate and supervise, and what are the relationships between these large non-banks and banks.

And, you know, we don't -- we don't have a preconceived answer to that. We just want to understand what are the -- you know, what are those business relationships like and what kind of risks does that mean the banks are running. That's all it is.


SCOTT FITZGERALD:
Thank you. Chairman, I yield back.


ANDY BARR:
The gentlewoman from New York, Ms. Velazquez, is now recognized.


NYDIA VELAZQUEZ:
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Chairman Powell, for being here this morning -- today. It's almost noon. Once the Fed is reassured that inflation is under control, what does the path back to neutral interest rates look like?


JEROME POWELL:
We've said that we wouldn't reduce rates until we were confident that inflation is moving sustainably down to 2 percent. I think the question of what is neutral is -- is -- is going to be an empirical question. I think -- it seems to me it's unlikely that we'll be going back to the very low interest rates of the pre-crisis period.

But we'll know that from -- you know, we won't know that until we -- until we get there, in a way.


NYDIA VELAZQUEZ:
And the Fed's dual mandate comprises of price stability and maximum sustainable employment. As the Fed is thinking about inflation and the possibility of interest rate cuts, how are you balancing these priorities with the need to maximize employment?


JEROME POWELL:
So over the past couple of years, we've had a very strong labor market and inflation well above target and that has led us to focus mainly on bringing down inflation. Over the course of two years, inflation has come down pretty significantly. There's more work to do there. We're not at our target. We need to keep on that job.

At the same time, the labor market has cooled pretty significantly. And so I would say those two goals are now much closer to being in balance. And that means from a policy standpoint, we need to be paying attention to both of them. Whereas for the last couple of years, really, we had to pay mostly attention to inflation.


NYDIA VELAZQUEZ:
Chairman Powell, I have told you that I will be asking for a status update on the section 956 rulemaking at every future hearing. Since your last appearance in March, several of your fellow regulators have issued a proposed rule. Why did the fed choose not to sign onto this proposal?


JEROME POWELL:
So what we're doing is we're looking at the current state of affairs as it relates to incentive compensation. As you may know, we've had guidance in place now since 2010 for all banks, and we supervise pretty significantly around that. So it's a very different picture than the one that was there in 2010. So we're asking ourselves what is the situation today and how do we tailor a proposal to address the residual risk, as opposed to what the situation in 2010 was.


NYDIA VELAZQUEZ:
Yes. In previous hearings, you said that you need to better understand the problem in order to write the rule. In a speech in June, SEC Commissioner Lizarraga said, and I quote, it has been well documented that in the lead up to the financial crisis, pay structures often Encourage big bets that maximize short-term profits, but ignore bigger longer term risks that threaten to take down the entire financial system.

Additionally, since your last appearance, several of your fellow regulators have moved toward with a proposed rule. Why have your fellow regulators and Commissioner Lizarraga been able to understand the scope of the problem and the fed has not?


JEROME POWELL:
Well, I think the quote absolutely makes my point, which is I think everyone agrees that incentive compensation practices before the global financial crisis were not in a good place. However, we published guidance on incentive compensation binding on all, or not binding, but guidance for all banks in 2010, after putting it out for comment.

A lot of thought went into that guidance and now we supervise in that guidance. And so the situation with incentive compensation now in banks is completely different than it was before the global financial crisis, completely different.


NYDIA VELAZQUEZ:
Well, the other regulators have been able to figure this out and you haven't. But let me just say, this is not how congressional mandates work. Of all the rule making provisions in the Dodd-Frank, only 148 were mandatory and of those, only 22 had a deadline of less than a year after enactment. Section 956 was one of them, and I hope that you come to the conclusion that it is your duty to issue the regulation.

Thank you and I yield back, Mr. Chairman.


JEROME POWELL:
Section 156 requires either a rule or guidance, by the way. It does not require a rule, a rule or a guidance. Thank you.


ANDY BARR:
The gentleman from Florida, Mr. Donalds, is now recognized.


BYRON DONALDS:
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Secretary Powell, it's good to see you. Let's cover a lot of different areas of ground. According to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, since President Biden took office, the price of goods has continued to outpace family incomes, with prices increasing now 19.3 percent, while average weekly earnings have only increased 14.6 percent, so families have fallen behind with respect to their purchasing power that they're able to go and acquire goods.

What role has government spending played in creating this untenable economic crisis?


JEROME POWELL:
Close that door please. I'm sorry, I can't hear very well when the doors open.


BYRON DONALDS:
I'll repeat. That's fine.


JEROME POWELL:
No, I heard you.


BYRON DONALDS:
OK. OK.


JEROME POWELL:
That needs to be closed. So what role, government spending as part of this story, so government spent, we had our rates really low. The pandemic happened and we closed the economy and then reopened it. And I think you saw burst of inflation everywhere in the world and certainly, there were many contributors to that.


BYRON DONALDS:
Do you think that the president and his budget calling for an increase of federal spending, upwards of five percent increase in federal spending across the board, do you think that's going to have further implications on stubborn inflation plaguing the pocketbooks of the American people?


JEROME POWELL:
It would be inappropriate for me to comment on the president's budget.


BYRON DONALDS:
The only reason why I would ask, Mr. Powell, is because obviously the Federal Reserve is having to respond to various aspects of fiscal policy coming from Capitol Hill. Regardless of the president's budget, would it be appropriate in the current environment for federal spending to increase five percent, 10 percent, 15 percent?


JEROME POWELL:
Honestly, that's a question for elected representatives. We don't play a role in fiscal policy.


BYRON DONALDS:
Fair enough. Is it the view of yourself and the Federal Reserve Board that fiscal policy does create impacts on the Fed's ability to manage monetary policy for the United States?


JEROME POWELL:
We take fiscal policy as a given and we're not commentators. We're not the Congressional Budget Office or the Office of Management Budget. Whatever fiscal policy happens up here, um, we decline all opportunities to be commentators on it. We take it as a given and that's because we didn't run for office. We don't have that job.

We stick to our knitting. The fact that we're independent really depends on us sticking to what our assignment is, which is to deal with the economy as it is.


BYRON DONALDS:
I would argue that the fiscal policy of the United States has given you guys a lot more to deal with and whatever the various burdens that come with it. Unfortunately, you have to tangle with it, but the American consumer is the one that truly has to deal with it. I'm going to move on. The Monetary policy report cites a pick-up in immigration as one of the major factors that has improved the supply of labor.

However, labor force participation rate remains below pre-pandemic levels. What percentage of the increased foreign born labor supply, to your knowledge, comes from illegal immigration?


JEROME POWELL:
What percentage of the of the--say it again, the question.


BYRON DONALDS:
What percentage of foreign born labor comes from illegal immigration?


JEROME POWELL:
I think all of the foreign born labor comes from immigration.


BYRON DONALDS:
No, illegal immigration.


JEROME POWELL:
Illegal. Sorry, I didn't get that.


BYRON DONALDS:
Yes, sir.


JEROME POWELL:
I don't know the answer to that.


BYRON DONALDS:
All right. Well, one of the things that I think will be important to help, I guess, advise congress on what to do going forward is if the Federal Reserve had some data to that regard to help us make further decisions into the future. Chairman Powell, let me ask you this one overarching question. Obviously, interest rates, if you compare it over the last 15 years of monetary policy, is at an elevated rate.

Does the fed anticipate any possibility of rates being lowered, whether it's 50 basis points, 100 basis points, at some point over the next year or two?


JEROME POWELL:
I guess the question really is where are interest rates going to settle out when all of the effects of the pandemic are really done, and no one knows. This is a great discussion to have. But I think my sense and pretty commonly, people think we probably won't go back to that era, between the global financial crisis and the pandemic where rates were very, very low and inflation was very low.

And extremely low. There were major European countries that had negative 10-year bond rates, negative, and that was not the case here. But I don't think we're going back to rates that are that low. We think that things like the neutral rate are driven by slow moving forces. But ultimately, you can see the effect.

Our policy rate is over five percent now and it feels like policy is restrictive but not intensely restrictive, so that that suggests that the neutral rate of interest at least as of now will have risen somewhat, which means rates will be a little higher.


BYRON DONALDS:
OK. Thank you so much. I yield back.


JEROME POWELL:
Thank you.


SCOTT FITZGERALD:
Gentleman yields back. We now go to the gentleman from California, Mr. Sherman, who is recognized for five minutes. Mr. Sherman? [Audio Gap] Would you like us to move on?


UNKNOWN:
If it's Josh's turn, it's Josh's turn.


SCOTT FITZGERALD:
Gentleman from New Jersey is recognized for five minutes.


JOSH GOTTHEIMER:
Thank you, Mr. Sherman and thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Powell, you have said that custody assets are off balance sheet, always have been and do you stand by that?


JEROME POWELL:
Sorry, say that again.


JOSH GOTTHEIMER:
You've said that, quote, custody assets are off balance sheet, always have been. Do you stand by that statement, sir?


JEROME POWELL:
I think as a general matter, yes.


JOSH GOTTHEIMER:
The SEC's Staff Accounting Bulletin 121 affects a core banking activity custody. The specific bulletin requires banks to put digital assets held in custody on their balance sheet, effectively keeping banks out of the market entirely. Have the fed and the SEC had conversations about the impact of SAB 121? And just wanted to get a sense of your thoughts on the policy, please.


JEROME POWELL:
So we, as you know, I think we don't comment on the SEC's policy. They don't comment on our policies either. So I knew you were going to SCB 121 on that, but honestly, it's the SEC's business, not ours.


JOSH GOTTHEIMER:
Thank you. Last month you said that when evaluating inflation data, you consider whether wage growth is outpacing productivity. From 1979 to 2019, middle class workers productivity grew about 60 percent, while their wages grew by about 16 percent. Do you consider this historical gap when considering whether to hike rates on families obviously struggling to make ends meet?


JEROME POWELL:
So we're looking at inflation and we're looking at maximum employment. Those are our goals. We don't really have the ability--we don't have a bunch of different tools for things like what you're talking about. So really, it's just those things, but of course, we're very well aware of longer run trends like that.

You have to also include benefits though in that analysis which does close that gap quite a bit. You just mentioned wages.


JOSH GOTTHEIMER:
I appreciate that. Thank you. Mr. Chairman, yesterday the director of National intelligence said that, quote, Iranian government actors have sought to opportunistically take advantage of ongoing protests. Regarding the war in Gaza, end quote. They have observed actors, quote, observed actors tied to Iran's government posing as activists online, seeking to encourage protests and even providing financial support to protesters, end quote.

As a member of the House Select Committee on Intelligence, I'm equally concerned about our adversaries meddling in our financial system. Can I have your commitment, or if you can discuss if you're working with other federal agencies to investigate and address foreign interference channeled through our financial institutions?


JEROME POWELL:
So we do take part in many of those things, especially at the staff level. And as you know, there's a lot of focus in the intelligence community and it's very helpful to the banks, the commercial banks and to us. But we're certainly very focused on those issues. We've got a strong team. Of course, you're never able to sleep on cyber risk.

But we just keep fighting it.


JOSH GOTTHEIMER:
I would like to switch gears to the discount window, please. Chairman, we've heard that the discount window is behind the times in terms of its operations. We also continue to hear that efforts to modernize the discount window and encourage its use will be ineffective without reducing the associated stigma.

The usability of the discount window is an important tool for banks that need liquidity. I just want to get a sense of efforts underway to make the discount window a more realistic option for banks that need liquidity.


JEROME POWELL:
So it's a couple of things. First, it is we need to modernize our infrastructure. The discount window in our system, it's not a primary source of credit. It's a source for banks that they can use under certain circumstances. But we know that that the infrastructure is a little tired and we're investing in that and making it more user friendly and all that.

So that's a big, big project that's going on. Sorry, the second point was stigma. So stigma, that's tough. That's a tough one. And it amounts to, there are a lot of ways to get after that. We're studying all of them. In a sense, if you require banks to use the discount window, then that can help with the stigma.

I mean, this is a big ask, but when congress required us to publish the names of discount window users, that didn't help. It doesn't help at all because banks basically say we're not going to use discount window because people might see us as troubled and that's not what we want. We want people to be able to freely use the discount window.

So we've been focused on this issue for a long time, have not made a lot of progress on it, but right now, I think we're very focused on it.


JOSH GOTTHEIMER:
Thank you, sir. I'll yield back. Thank you.


SCOTT FITZGERALD:
Gentleman yields back. We now go to the gentleman from New York, Mr. Lawler, who is recognized for five minutes.


MIKE LAWLER:
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Powell, to the best of my knowledge, the last public meeting between you and President Biden occurred on May 31st, 2022. Does that sound accurate?


JEROME POWELL:
I'm going to take your word for it.


MIKE LAWLER:
OK. Have you had any private meetings with the president since that time?


JEROME POWELL:
No.


MIKE LAWLER:
Any phone calls with the president?


JEROME POWELL:
I don't believe so.


MIKE LAWLER:
Is there any reason why you've not met with or spoken to the president?


JEROME POWELL:
I mean, I meet with--when any president calls you, you come and you meet, but that hasn't happened.




MIKE LAWLER:
So in over two years, with inflation still nagging us, with costs out of control, President Biden hasn't asked to meet with you in over two years?


JEROME POWELL:
I haven't had a meeting with him. He hasn't sought a meeting and of course, I don't seek meetings. So you have the date.


MIKE LAWLER:
But to your knowledge, in the last two years, you've not spoken with or met with the president at all?


JEROME POWELL:
I shook his hand in a line once, but that wasn't a conversation. It was just, Mr. President and that was it. It was at a state dinner. I attended a state dinner a few months ago and I shook his hand, good evening, Mr. President and that was it.


MIKE LAWLER:
Does that not strike you as odd, that the president has not sought to meet with you?


JEROME POWELL:
Not at all. Not at all.


AL GREEN:
Mr. Chairman? Mr. Chairman? Parliamentary inquiry, please, Mr. Chairman. Am I recognized?


SCOTT FITZGERALD:
State your inquiry.


AL GREEN:
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I make a point of order under clause four of rule 17 that the gentleman's words are disorderly and violate the rules of decorum and debate insofar as they are negatively reflecting upon the personality of a candidate for president of the United States.


SCOTT FITZGERALD:
The congressman has not engaged in any personality or in any--has questioned anything about anyone at this point. I'm not sure where you're going, Congressman. Congressman is recognized.


MIKE LAWLER:
Thank you. Thank you.


JEROME POWELL:
I'm happy to answer your question. Can I answer your question?


MIKE LAWLER:
Thank you.


AL GREEN:
Mr. Chairman, I'd like to continue with the point of order, please.


SCOTT FITZGERALD:
What is your point of order?


AL GREEN:
Mr. Chairman, we have been admonished in this committee that we should not have words that negatively reflect upon persons who are running for president. This would include Mr. Trump, as well as the current president.


MIKE LAWLER:
Didn't the ranking member do a whole opening monologue diatribe about some ridiculous project 2025?


AL GREEN:
Would you please rule my friend out of order, Mr. Chairman, until you rule?


SCOTT FITZGERALD:
Mr. Lawler has not admonished or said anything negative about the president at all. I just listened to his comments. So I'm going to recognize the congressman again, Mr. Lawler, from New York.


MIKE LAWLER:
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Powell, you were trying to answer my question.


JEROME POWELL:
So we're an independent agency. The administration has been very respectful of the fed and not wanting to try to influence and things like that. And I don't find it at all unusual. I've been at the fed for this is my 13th year and I think there can go by long periods of time when the fed chair doesn't meet with the president and that's totally fine.


MIKE LAWLER:
OK. Since you made mention of the independence of the fed and I know you pride yourself in that independence, do you acknowledge or do members of the FOMC acknowledge that a rate cut in September could be viewed as political just 30 to 60 days before an election?


JEROME POWELL:
So our undertaking is to make decisions when and as they need to be made based on the data, the incoming data, the evolving outlook and the balance of risks and not in consideration of other factors. And that would include political factors. We will make those decisions. We have a long history of doing that, including during election years.

And that is the undertaking we'll make. Anything we do will be very well grounded. And it's just not appropriate for us to get into the business of thinking about election cycles at all, one way or the other.


MIKE LAWLER:
So inflation year over year from May 2023 to May 2024 is up 3.3 percent, overall inflation. Energy inflation is up 3.7 percent. Food inflation up 2.1 percent. With inflation continuing to be a challenge, do you see a rate cut as a possibility at this moment?


JEROME POWELL:
So I think you're quoting the CPI numbers, which are operating at an unusually high gap to the PCE. For 25 years, the fed has focused on personal consumption expenditures inflation, PCE inflation and usually, the gap to CPI is only 25 or 30 basis points. It's more now, so the PCE numbers, the current PCE numbers are 2.6 percent for headline, 2.6 percent for core.

And we've articulated for a good long period our test for being willing to consider uh beginning to loosen policy. And that test is that we -- we want to be more confident that inflation is moving on a path sustainably down to two percent, not at two percent, but on a path sustainably to two percent. That's the test we've articulated.

I have some confidence, as I said earlier, that that we are on a downward path. I think if you look at the data, it's pretty clear, but we have not said though that we have sufficient confidence and that will be a decision that our committee makes.


MIKE LAWLER:
Yeah. I would just note, obviously CPI, the price of goods, the price of purchasing a home, the price of a mortgage, the cost of a mortgage has been astronomical. In Westchester County, for instance, where I represent, the average mortgage cost is up $1,000 a month, over $12,000 a year. In the time I have remaining, quick question.

In your meetings with the President, have you noticed any mental or cognitive decline?


JEROME POWELL:
No.


MIKE LAWLER:
Thank you. I yield back.


AL GREEN:
Point of order.


SCOTT FITZGERALD:
Gentleman's time has expired. Gentleman --


AL GREEN:
Point of order, Mr. Chairman.


SCOTT FITZGERALD:
Point of order.


AL GREEN:
Yes, Mr. Chairman. The gentleman just mentioned the president's cognitive capacity and I believe this to be a violation of the rules with relationship to decorum and that this goes into a personality of a president.


SCOTT FITZGERALD:
Gentleman's time had expired. You're recognized now for your five minutes, Mr. Green.


AL GREEN:
My point of order is to be made immediately after the gentleman's statement, and that's what I'm doing.


SCOTT FITZGERALD:
I would remind members not to engage in personalities and comments about the president.


AL GREEN:
But Mr. Chairman, if I may, with my point of order, I demand that the gentleman's words be taken down insofar as they negatively reflect upon a candidate for president of the United States.


SCOTT FITZGERALD:
Gentleman from New York, Mr. Lawler, is recognized.


MIKE LAWLER:
I'll happily withdraw my words, though everybody understood them.


AL GREEN:
Mr. Chairman?


SCOTT FITZGERALD:
Gentleman withdraws his comments. Mr. Green, you're recognized.


AL GREEN:
I find his final--if I may, Mr. Chairman, his final comment was although everybody understood them. In my opinion, that then brings us right back to where we were before he made his attempt to withdraw. Now, if he's willing to withdraw appropriately, I will not demand, but until he does so, I demand that his words be taken down.


SCOTT FITZGERALD:
The gentleman's time had expired.


AL GREEN:
Mr. Chairman, the time does not expire on the request that I've made, the point of order. The time didn't expire on that.


SCOTT FITZGERALD:
I recognize Mr. Lawler.


MIKE LAWLER:
Let the record reflect, I withdraw my words.


AL GREEN:
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.


SCOTT FITZGERALD:
Gentleman from Texas, Mr. Green, is now recognized for his five minutes.


AL GREEN:
Thank you, Mr. Chairman and I thank the chair for appearing today. I hope things are going well with you. I know that this is a difficult time for you and quite frankly, you've been in a difficult time for a number of years, and you've proved to be quite resilient and quite effective at what you do, so I thank you for what you're doing.

I do want to ask you about several things, and I hope that I'll get to them. But first, there was a post failure lessons report after the failure of Silicon Valley and Signature banks. I thought that report was pretty important. How important is that post failure lessons report?


JEROME POWELL:
It's important. We wanted to learn the right lessons and make the right changes to both our rules, but also, really to our supervisory practices more than anything else and we're doing that.


AL GREEN:
And is this something that you believe to be important after each incident, such as what happened with Silicon and the other bank?


JEROME POWELL:
Yes. I think we all have a lot to be humble about and we try to learn from events.


AL GREEN:
Thank you. Let me go on to the next question, which has to do with the banks that are small. Let's talk about those that are less than $5 billion in total assets, yet they are subject to the special assessments of the FDIC once there is a systemic risk exception triggered. I'd like to see them exempt from that.

Do you have any comments on it?


JEROME POWELL:
That's either a statutory matter or it's a matter of the FDIC's practice. So it's not something the fed has any input into, really.


AL GREEN:
OK. Let's do this next, please. As time runs out, uh, would you kindly finish your commentary? You were giving a comment on the pandemic and how the pandemic helped to generate this inflation and you were stopped in the middle of your comment. So would you go back through that, please, so that the public at large can get a better understanding of what actually happened with the pandemic and inflation?


JEROME POWELL:
So I'd be glad to, and I think people are now--we have a few years to look back. I think the more years that pass, the clearer we can see what was happening. But I think you look back now and you're seeing this--broadly, what was happening was governments did a lot to support economic activity during the pandemic.

And on the theory that there could be a really serious economic bad times ahead. Then the economy reopened, and it reopened very, very strongly. And I think in hindsight, you can see that there was just a lot of support for demand from fiscal policy, from monetary policy, and that supply was constrained.

You couldn't make cars. Supply chains were tangled up. There were shortages of so many things. So what happened was we got a burst of inflation, and the United States got a big burst of inflation, really more from demand than other countries. Did then you have the war in Ukraine, which gave a big burst of inflation, more to Europe than to us and so you wind up with a situation where you've just got a lot of inflation.

And our thinking, my thinking at the time was it's going to take restrictive monetary policy and it's going to take time for the supply side and demand side distortions from the pandemic to unwind. 2023 was the year when that kind of happened. So supply chains were fixed, the labor shortage was greatly alleviated, and unemployment remained very low.

Inflation came down by a very large amount last year, while growth remained quite strong. So this was the year that kind of proved that thesis. Now we're in 2024 and it's a question of finishing the job on inflation, which we're committed to do, while also keeping a strong labor market, which we're also committed to doing.

And that's a balance that we have to strike in our policy. But I think we know more now about where this came from because we can see what made it go away. And it was a combination of supply and demand, as we had kind of expected.


AL GREEN:
And two of the most significant factors were the pandemic and the war with Ukraine, is that correct?


JEROME POWELL:
Yes, and it's also the fact that the pandemic summoned forth a great fiscal and monetary response and that contributed to really strong activity and to inflation, without question.


AL GREEN:
We're going to run out of time, but I have to ask, but if not for that monetary response, I know that it's a counterfactual, but would we have possibly gone into a depression?


JEROME POWELL:
That's what we thought at the time, and I think mainstream economists were very concerned that--we'd never literally shut the global economy down for a period and then tried to reopen it. We didn't know how long it would take or how well that would go.


AL GREEN:
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.


SCOTT FITZGERALD:
Gentleman's time has expired. We now go to the gentleman from Oklahoma, Mr. Lucas, who is recognized for five minutes.


FRANK LUCAS:
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thank you, Chairman Powell, for testifying today. I realize that my questioning point in the hearing today, probably a lot of material has been covered, but there's nothing ever wrong with asking important questions a second or third time. You've reiterated how members of the board would like to see a revised Boswell proposal put out for public comment and you're working through the process with FDIC and OCC. From my perspective, the FDIC is in a period of uncertainty.

The current chairman announcing he'll resign to restore confidence in his agency and the replacement is awaiting Senate confirmation hearings. And at the OCC, we have an acting comptroller who has not been yet confirmed by the Senate. At the very least, given the expected broad revisions, I hope the other agencies agree that a complete re-proposal would be appropriate.

So Chairman, could you give me some indication of what the potential timeline around such a decision repropose might look like?


JEROME POWELL:
It's pretty uncertain, but I'll give it a shot.


FRANK LUCAS:
Please.


JEROME POWELL:
And I'll say again that these discussions we've been having with the other two agencies have been very constructive and we very much want that to continue. We've got pretty good agreement on the substance and now it's about the process. So, you know, a baseline might be that we agree on a -- on a re-proposal of some kind that -- that -- you know, that -- that gives the public a chance to see these changes and react to them and write comment letters.

And so, that -- that could happen. You know, we -- it would take us a while to write it up, and -- and then we'd put it out for 60 days. I see -- I think that couldn't happen probably until part of the way through the fall. Then -- then there would be, let's say, 60 days of comment. And we'd get the comments.

We'd have to then evaluate the comments and think carefully about them. Having done that, we'd have to write up the final version, and that would take some time. So, that -- that probably puts you -- my guess is it puts you well into next year. As I mentioned, these rules are going to be -- these are rules that the banks are going to have to live with for a long time, and -- and we need to get them right.

It's not something we -- we should be hurrying on. We -- we need to take our time and get it right and make sure that we hear the comments. This is a very big piece of regulation. A lot of things will need to be changed. There are a lot of good things in there. We want to come out with a good proposal, and that's what it'll take.


FRANK LUCAS:
To shift gears on you, Chairman, the 2024 stress test focused on commercial real estate risk, which is an area we've all been paying close attention to here on this committee. Do you agree that the results showed the financial system to be strong?


JEROME POWELL:
Yes, I do.


FRANK LUCAS:
Folks back home are always very concerned about inflation and the period we've gone through lately, not just the basic necessities that continue to explode, but the cost of doing business and all those other issues. The fact is that inflation still running above the Fed's 2 percent target, and we've seen significant price increases in food and energy over recent years.

As you and I have discussed before, I started out as young farmer in 1977 in that inflationary period during the Carter years, then when we went through Chairman Volcker's rather, shall we say, dramatic tightening of monetary policy, and I still remember paying 17 percent to borrow calf feed money when I was a student in college.

I was well collateralized, but that was a bargain in the fact that the capital's accessible. So, I'm particularly sensitive, being a part of that -- that generation, that if inflation isn't effectively dealt with it can spiral out of control. Could you expand for a little bit more about your approach in dealing with inflation in a way that doesn't repeat the mistakes of the past?

I just want to avoid the mistakes of the past.


JEROME POWELL:
So, I -- I think, really, one of the big lessons coming out of the big -- the high inflation of the '70s, which we both lived through, is that it really is on the central bank to be on the case and do the job and -- and make sure that it is fully well and truly done, and -- and that -- really, that is up to the central bank.

And believe it or not, that wasn't fully accepted or that wasn't necessarily the thinking. And also, the independence of central banks was much less respected back then. So, all the more credit to Paul -- Paul Volcker for having the -- the courage to do it. So, we -- we now -- that is an internalized lesson for people in central banking these days.

We do understand that. We are committed to bringing inflation sustainably down to 2 percent.


FRANK LUCAS:
One last question in my remaining seconds. You and the leadership of the Fed's will be there the day before the election this fall and you'll be there the day after the election. Still be the same people carefully watching the Fed's responsibilities, correct?


JEROME POWELL:
This is my fourth presidential election at the Fed. And I can tell you we come to the work the next day and we do our jobs.


SCOTT FITZGERALD:
Gentleman's time has expired. We'll now go to the gentleman from California, Mr. Sherman.


BRAD SHERMAN:
Coming out of COVID, everyone said a soft landing was impossible and a recession was inevitable. I want to commend you and the administration. It looks like we've seen a soft landing. We've continued to have historically low unemployment rates, and historically low unemployment rates for people of color.

And in the last 18 months, we've seen a 4.7 point decline in the inflation rate as measured by the consumer price index. Is that the greatest decline or -- I realize you may not have done the calculations, but I did the calculations. It's the greatest decline that we've seen in an 18 month period this century.

Do you have any reason to disagree with that?


JEROME POWELL:
I hope that's true. And I'm glad you said it because it's -- it's certainly a lot. I -- I can't validate the -- the -- the statement, though.


BRAD SHERMAN:
I'm sure you have a fine staff that will do the calculation, and hopefully we'll see the press release. When Secretary Yellen was here yesterday, I addressed an issue that both you and her should be concerned with. I've always opposed Operation Choke Point where, for political reasons, banks wouldn't provide or might not provide financial services.

Florida and Tennessee have passed laws giving anybody who's denied a bank account or even a loan a way to claim that that was for political reasons, and it opens up the possibility that banks would be pressured by those laws to release their suspicious activity reports, which are -- I understand are -- are supposed to be private.

And so, I hope you'll work with the secretary in making sure that the laws of Florida and Tennessee do not adversely affect our ability to deal with suspicious financial circumstances. You have a dual mandate. I think there's -- you have a third mandate that is implied, because the budget deficit poses a great risk to price stability and to employment -- keeping unemployment low.

And you don't deal with spending. You don't deal with taxation. But in two ways, you dramatically affect the budget deficit. The federal government is the biggest borrower in the history of the world. Interest rates affect the forthcoming budget deficit. And at times, you've turned over to the federal government up to $100 billion in profit.

And so, I hope that you would consider whether your first two mandates imply that you at least have to look at how your policies affect the budget deficit. I'm -- hope that you will go with republication of Basel III and insist on that. I know you're dealing with two other regulators on that. A recent assessment by Price Waterhouse Coopers showed that the original proposal would lead to higher borrowing costs for small and medium sized businesses.

And in every way, Basel III seemed to be slanted toward telling the banks go and put your money on Wall Street, where you just are going to have interest rate risk, and don't loan your money to local Main Street businesses because there's credit risk there. And in fact, if you added a fair system, you would mark-to-market all bonds, not just those that are, quote, available for sale.

I hope also that, as you redo Basel III, you treat energy tax credits -- green energy tax credits the same way you currently deal with low income housing tax credits, that you keep in mind the effect on the securities industry, particularly municipal bonds, that you don't unfairly to local business say that, if it's a publicly traded company, it counts only 65 percent, and that you look at mortgage servicing rights as an asset, and that you fully account for the mortgage -- private mortgage insurance.

I -- I know you give some credit for that. But frankly, a 80 percent loan to value and a 90 percent loan to value that has private mortgage insurance pretty much expose the bank to the same risk. I'll -- I'll ask you one question about the debit cards. You're planning to provide only, I believe, a 0.3 -- $0.03 additional charge for dealing with fraud prevention.

Fraud -- fraud has just skyrocketed. Would the Fed consider increasing the fraud prevention adjustment before finalizing its proposal?


JEROME POWELL:
And that's -- that's part of the comments that we've received on the interchange rule. And it's something we're -- that's a concern that we're aware of. And we'll take that into consideration.


BRAD SHERMAN:
I yield back.


ROGER WILLIAMS:
The gentleman yields back. And now we -- the gentleman from the great state of Missouri, Congressman Luetkemeyer, is now recognized for five minutes.


BLAINE LUETKEMEYER:
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I -- I certainly appreciate the thoughtful gentleman from California's remarks on some of the stuff. But I'm kind of curious how -- Chairman Powell, he indicated you've got a third implied duty here to actually work with the budget. I really thought that only the Congress had the ability to impact the budget.

We're the ones. Not even the legislative, not the executive branch, not the judicial branch, the legislative branch is the one that handles the budget. Am I mistaken on that, Mr. Chairman?


JEROME POWELL:
I believe that is right.


BLAINE LUETKEMEYER:
I -- I -- I don't think you want our job on top of what you got.


JEROME POWELL:
No.


BLAINE LUETKEMEYER:
One of the things that's come across my desk in the last few weeks here is some of the legislatures this last year around the country have started to pass banking laws that infringe on federal banking laws. Have you seen this? Are you aware of it? You have thoughts on it? Can you tell me what your thoughts may be?


JEROME POWELL:
Honestly, I have not seen that, and I --


BLAINE LUETKEMEYER:
Okay.


JEROME POWELL:
It wouldn't -- wouldn't necessarily come across my desk. It might come across Vice Chair Barr's desk more.


BLAINE LUETKEMEYER:
Okay. Well, I was just concerned because, I mean, you handle lots of banking rules and regulations. And so, we don't want to have the state usurp the duties and responsibilities and the -- the legal ability to --


JEROME POWELL:
These are preemption issues?


BLAINE LUETKEMEYER:
Yes, preemption issue is what it's all about.


JEROME POWELL:
Yeah, that's -- that's a big deal for the OCC --


BLAINE LUETKEMEYER:
Yeah.


JEROME POWELL:
As you know.


BLAINE LUETKEMEYER:
So, I'm just curious if you'd want to cross any of that, have any thoughts on it.


JEROME POWELL:
I have not.


BLAINE LUETKEMEYER:
Okay. One of the things -- I just got done coming out of a committee hearing with Small Business a while ago, and there was a home builder individual there, a contractor, and he was talking about the cost of regulations. You know, basically a $1,000 increase in costs costs about $100,000 -- 100,000 homes across the country not being able to be purchased because they're no longer affordable.

And so, it brings up the point with regards to cost of regulations. You know, do you fall under the Administrative Procedures Act?


JEROME POWELL:
Yes.


BLAINE LUETKEMEYER:
So, part of that act is to determine the cost of a regulation, correct, or the cost of compliance?


JEROME POWELL:
I don't actually know the answer to that.


BLAINE LUETKEMEYER:
Okay. Yeah.


JEROME POWELL:
But I know we follow carefully the APA.


BLAINE LUETKEMEYER:
Okay. But, I mean, to me, that's a really important point from the standpoint of how you look at rules and regulations to ensure that the cost is not going to be more than the economic benefit of what you're doing. So, I mean, this has to be part of your analysis, I would think.


JEROME POWELL:
Certainly, we -- we try to make our -- our rules as efficient as possible and as -- and to get the job done.


BLAINE LUETKEMEYER:
One of the concerns we have is with -- I think the gentleman talked about the credit card situation here, Reg II. And with regards to the Chevron doctrine basically being rescinded, how is that going to affect your rule making with regards to some of the more recent ones, like the Reg II fees and stuff, the Basel rule?

Are all those things are going to be impacted by this at all?


JEROME POWELL:
I mean, it doesn't change the -- you know, our assignment under the -- under the Durbin amendment to do the interchange rule. So, we -- we -- you know, we're always focused as an institution on compliance with the law. We're a very law abiding group, so --


BLAINE LUETKEMEYER:
But does it narrow -- does it narrow your ability to -- to go beyond or reinterpret laws and rules and things like that? It seems to me that's what the rule -- what the purpose --


JEROME POWELL:
Well, you know, that'll be a question for the courts. I mean, the court -- courts will be asking the same question, which is what was Congress's intent with --


BLAINE LUETKEMEYER:
Yeah.


JEROME POWELL:
For that law. And that's the question we're asking. But there's -- what they're saying is courts will give less deference to agencies, I think.


BLAINE LUETKEMEYER:
Okay.


JEROME POWELL:
Again, these -- these -- these decisions were just passed down. I was actually out of the country last week while this was all happening. I've had no time to be briefed on any of that. So, I -- I'd be -- I'm kind of speculating here.


BLAINE LUETKEMEYER:
Okay. One -- one last question. I asked this question yesterday of Secretary Yellen. What keeps you up at night? What is your biggest concern? With regards to your responsibilities to -- with regards to the economy, regards to the banking system, what is your biggest concern?


JEROME POWELL:
So, for a long time I -- it's been cyber. And the reason is, you know, we know about credit crises and things like that and financial crises. But we haven't really had something where there's a successful cyber attack on a major financial institution or -- or financial market utility. That's always been my answer.

I would actually say now the number one thing that just does keep me awake at night is what -- the balance that I talked about before, which is we're at the critical time of inflation's coming down, the labor market is -- is cooling, and we want to get it right for the benefit of the American people. We want to get inflation down to 2 percent, but we want to keep a strong labor market too.

And trying to make decisions that -- that give that the best chance to happen, that's -- that is the thing that I think about in the wee hours.


BLAINE LUETKEMEYER:
You know, we've talked about this before too. You really got a tough job from the standpoint you're trying to drive down demand. And the administration, by spending all this money, is trying to drive it up. It puts you in a really big box, doesn't it? Thank you. Mr. Chair. I yield back.


ROGER WILLIAMS:
The gentleman yields back. Now we have the gentleman from the great state of Illinois. Congressman Foster is now recognized for five minutes.


BILL FOSTER:
Oh, thank you, Mr. Chairman and -- and Chair Powell. You know, I guess when things are going well it's -- as they currently are, it's all of our duties to look around the curve and see it -- the risks that keep you up at night. So, I appreciate Representative Luetkemeyer's question. Now, over the last few years, there have been increasing interest in synthetic risk transfers, SRTs, or credit linked notes, which are often used by US banks to shift risk away from the banking system and as a means of managing regulatory capital.



BILL FOSTER:
So, I've been concerned by recent reports that the buyers of some of these SRTs may be investing in them using bank provided leverage, in which case the risk could just boomerang right back into the banking system. Frankly, when I read about this, it triggered my PTSD from the AIG situation, with credit default swaps during the financial crisis. Now, I understand the Federal Reserve plays a role in approving SRTs, in fact, issued guidance to US Banks regarding their issuance last fall.

Could you say a little bit about the ways that these investments can be a safe way for banks to offload risk and in what ways they could become a dangerous source of contagion?


JEROME POWELL:
Sure. So there could be a breakdown in a couple of places in the chain, as you're obviously aware. One is just that the risk isn't really well and fully transferred to the buyer. And the first step is, is that risk going away off the balance sheet in an unconditional kind of a way, in a way that the bank understands.

And that's a good thing if banks are able to do that. Then the question is, is it coming back through the back door with financing. And so we're well aware of that. Banks do tend to bring these things to us, and we look at them carefully. We understand some of the ways it can go wrong. But at the end of the day, if it works to reduce the risk on a bank's balance sheet, that's something we should be okay with.


BILL FOSTER:
But there's the -- well, if you just, what sort of insight and control does the Federal Reserve have into all the connections, particularly when the connection may go through businesses that you do not have direct -- non-bank entities that you may not have direct oversight over?


JEROME POWELL:
My understanding is that this is a very active dialog we're having with banks. They want to know how this is going to be treated. They don't want to do something that is going to come back on them or that we will deny the treatment on. So I think there's a pretty transparent set of exchanges around how these things work.

We're very clear on what we think our requirements are. This is what I'm told, and so we saw what went wrong the last time. I think no one wants to repeat that, including the banks.


BILL FOSTER:
Well, if you conclude and what is you're actively studying, that you need more visibility into certain areas of particularly non-bank things that might be part of the chain of contagion, please let us know because it's our job to avoid the next crisis. I think it's my personal goal to die before we have another financial crisis and then I'll be doing my job well.

Now, I understand also the value of stress in the US are relatively small in the bulk of these are offshore. Is the growth of this practice internationally something you're watching closely? And is there anything that might provide a sign of early trouble in terms of international contagion that might creep back in?


JEROME POWELL:
So I haven't heard that flavor of it, but I'll check on that and let you know.


BILL FOSTER:
Do you remember the -- with AIG, the real problem with AIG falling into bankruptcy is that it would immediately put a bazillion of the European banks into violation of their capital requirements, which was major contagion. So do you have a sense of the time scale for the liquidity proposal at this point?


JEROME POWELL:
I think the main thing is we have this very large important project on Basel three and I think we're pretty close to being able to move that out into the public view again. And I think once we've done that, we can move on to the other things that are there and one of them is the liquidity proposals. And I don't want to put a specific time frame on it, but we're certainly working toward that sometime later this year, I would think.


BILL FOSTER:
Later this year, we'll have the first view of that?


JEROME POWELL:
I would think so.


BILL FOSTER:
OK. I understand it's still under negotiation between agencies, but can you say directionally the Basel three, the new amended proposal, is it just going to be in the direction of sort of weakening it, watering things down toward the current capital requirements or will there be areas where it's actually strengthening them?


JEROME POWELL:
Oh, no, there will be a capital requirement in it that is consistent with Basel three and a capital increase that's consistent with --


BILL FOSTER:
My question is, if you look at what the original proposal was compared to what you intend to put out, are you moving in the direction of more toward the current situation? And if so, if you can just interpolate. It seems like if you have comments the proposal you put out, you understand comments on the status quo and you're somewhere between that, then maybe you don't need another set of comments because everything that can be said has been said.


JEROME POWELL:
It's a little more complicated than that, but that's essentially right. You have current levels of capital, you have the proposal, and you have -- which is a lot of gold plating and then you have where it's shaking out and that's --


BILL FOSTER:
So I just was wondering why you need more comments --


JEROME POWELL:
There are many different pieces. The answer is there are many, many different pieces of that. It's not just --


BILL FOSTER:
Thank you. And I'm over time and --


ROGER WILLIAMS:
Gentleman's time is up. Next, the gentlewoman from the great state of Indiana, Congresswoman Houchin is now recognized for five minutes.


ERIN HOUCHIN:
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you to the ranking member and thank you Chairman Powell for coming to speak with us today. It's been a long day, so thank you for being here this entire time. One of the greatest strengths of our financial services industry is the diversity of our banking system. I know firsthand how important it is for us to maintain options and choice for Americans, whether it's somebody looking to open a savings account or take out a loan to start a small business.

Increasingly, however, we have seen consolidation in the banking industry and increased difficulty for smaller financial institutions to survive. One of the reasons for this is an excessive regulatory burden that many of the smaller banks face. While this can come in the form of new proposals and adjustments to liquidity requirements or to things like Basel three endgame, it can also be due to outdated technological capabilities at the agencies and inefficiencies in and within the examination process.

Chairman Powell, could you just talk about what steps the fed is taking to upgrade technology and procurement procedures and update training practices to ensure that the banks that you regulate don't face unnecessary burdens?


JEROME POWELL:
So to your point, the number of banks in the country has been coming down for 40 years and there's consolidation going on for a whole range of reasons. And we're not trying to foster that. We're not trying to push that and we're aware that high fixed costs from regulation may be one of the reasons for that.

So we do try to keep that in mind, particularly for the smaller institutions. On your question around IT and specific things, I might take an opportunity to come back to you with somebody who's closer to the specific supervisory practices. It's a fair question.


ERIN HOUCHIN:
That would be great question. That'd be great. And just for reference, I was proud earlier this year to introduce a bill, the Fostering the Use of Technology to Uphold Regulatory Effectiveness in Supervision Act or the FUTURES Act. It's an important bill that would require our federal bank regulators to conduct an assessment to ensure that the technology and training systems they are using will improve and reduce the burden especially on our smaller financial institutions.

At the same time, the bill will strengthen the safety and soundness of our financial system by keeping our regulators up to date on the latest Fintech innovations. So I was glad to see that act, the Futures Act moved through the markup earlier this year. I certainly hope to see it come to a floor vote soon.

Chairman Powell, in your comments yesterday in the Senate you said Basel three will need a quote meaningful revamp before we proceed toward finalization of that rule. I was glad to hear you say that, considering 97 percent of public comments on Basel three were negative, with 86 percent of that negative feedback coming from outside the banking sector.

Many of my colleagues here today have highlighted their own concerns with Basel three. Given the pressure that Americans are already facing with inflation and increased interest rates and housing market stalls, I would urge that you take a good long look at the cumulative effect of this rule in context with the broader economy, our small and mid-sized banks, not just the larger financial institutions.

Will a meaningful revamp include consideration of the hardships that over regulations cause for smaller financial institutions like those that are essential to rural communities like mine in southern Indiana?


JEROME POWELL:
I think it will, yes.


ERIN HOUCHIN:
And are you concerned about the consolidation that we are seeing in the banking sector? I know you said it's been going on for 40 years. Does consolidation in the banking sector concern you? And are you concerned that the broader effect of cumulative rules uh is potentially leading to a further consolidation in the banking sector?


JEROME POWELL:
Again, we don't want to be part of the reason for that consolidation. It seems to be happening though organically. We allowed interstate banking, for example. Also, I think there for a long time the learning was there weren't a lot of economies of scale in banking. I think with all the technology costs, that old learning is now not really true.

And so I do think -- in fact, I think a lot of the sort of smaller regionals do feel that they need to grow to be able to compete with the larger regionals. And also, the very largest banks are also present as you well know, in many, many communities where they weren't 30 years ago. So I think people are seeing a need for scale from a business standpoint and we don't want to push consolidation.

I think we also don't want to stand in the way of it, if that's what's necessary for banks to compete with the largest banks.


ERIN HOUCHIN:
I appreciate that. Thank you, Chairman Powell, again for your testimony. Our financial system is really the envy of the world. We need to make sure that small and growing institutions have the tools they need to innovate without any undue burden. I appreciate your emphasis on that in the meaningful revamp.

Thank you, Mr. Chairman and I yield back.


JEROME POWELL:
Thank you.


ROGER WILLIAMS:
Next, the gentleman who set a record for mile run this morning in Washington D.C., from Illinois, Mr. Casten is now recognized for five minutes.


SEAN CASTEN:
Thank you. Mr. Chairman, you, you looked much better and well-coiffed when I saw you this morning than I was. Nice to see you again, Chair Powell. Just briefly on the Basel three reforms, you and I have talked about the tax equity provisions and the fact that clean energy tax equity got a four times risk weighting relative to other tax equity in the last version.

If there is a proposal, can you give us any visibility on whether clean energy tax equity will go back to the 100 percent risk weighting that it's historically had?


JEROME POWELL:
So I'm not going to give any specifics out today because the usual arrangement is nothing is agreed until everything is agreed. So I don't want to get into what the specifics are. I'm hopeful that the three agencies can come out pretty soon with the whole package.


SEAN CASTEN:
OK. Well, the sooner even something temporary because there are a lot of banks that want to participate that are, I think, more cautious than they need to be right now. Appreciate that. In 2021, I think you were a part of the FSOC report on climate related financial risk that for the first time identified climate change as an emerging threat to US financial stability.

Do you still agree with that conclusion?


JEROME POWELL:
The conclusion being what again?


SEAN CASTEN:
That climate change was an emerging threat to US financial stability.


JEROME POWELL:
Yeah.


SEAN CASTEN:
OK. I raise that because I've been troubled, as you know, from some of the letters we've written by this April Bloomberg report that said, number one, that fed officials were pressuring the Basel committee to make disclosures of banks transition plans optional, and that succeeded. Number two, that the fed, OCC and FDIC were pushing to limit implementation of the Basel Committee's climate risk management principal principles to remove financed emissions.

And number three, that the US unlike other countries did not propose that any of its banks be subject to an analysis of how they incorporated climate in their credit risk assessments. Have any representatives from your agency attempted to weaken the Basel Committee's work on climate risk, including by expressing concern about the Basel Committee overstepping its mandate with respect to its climate work?


JEROME POWELL:
Well, I guess I would say it this way, the fed does not have a mandate of fostering an energy transition or dealing with climate change. Some of the northern European banks feel that they do. They actually have that. It's in their mandate either explicitly or implicitly, but we don't.


SEAN CASTEN:
But if we agree that climate change is an emerging threat to the stability of the banking system -- are you saying you're not acting on it because you don't have the authority or you're not acting on it because you disagree with what you said in 2021?


JEROME POWELL:
And I agree, there's an emerging threat to financial stability. That's over time. I think looking to the banking agencies to lead the fight on climate change is a big mistake. I think it's a job for elected people. We don't have that mandate in the United States. We can do a very limited thing which is make sure that the institutions we supervise are aware of and can manage those risks.

We are not going to be the ones who are forcing them to adopt plans to transition and that kind of thing. That's just not going to happen through the banking agencies without a law change.


SEAN CASTEN:
So then if it is the view of the rest of the world that climate change is a financial risk and we're going to regulate our banks, is that the view of the fed that the US G-SIBs should not be required to report?


JEROME POWELL:
Again we're not going to be climate policy makers at the fed. We are not going to do that. We don't have that mandate. A key to our independence is that we stick to the job you've given us. And the idea that we should discover climate and say, OK, we're going to lead the fight on climate, it just -- if we're going to do things like that, we should be part of the Treasury Department.


SEAN CASTEN:
Well, so to be clear, no one's under the illusions that you're the EPA. But I spoke with Janet Yellen about this yesterday. We have multiple states where the insurance industry is collapsing, something like, as you know well, something like a third to 40 percent of US wealth is tied up in real estate. And OK, US homeowners are not G-SIBs, but in the 2008 financial crisis, we had risk that moved out of the G-SIBs onto other entities' balance sheets.

And we said, well, we're not responsible because it's an insurance company. Well, we've fixed that. You do now have a mandate if there's systemic risk in the system. And so the question is, if we know that risk is moving through the system, is the FSOC monitoring that risk or is the FSOC view that if I'm not allowed to look at it, I'm not going to look at it. And it's somebody else's problem.

Because somebody else is the person sitting here, right?


JEROME POWELL:
I mean --


SEAN CASTEN:
We're going to be accountable if that risk comes -- when those chickens come home to roost.


JEROME POWELL:
Well, the banks -- the banks know their risks pretty well. And you'll see -- you see the banks and the insurance companies pulling back from lending in coastal areas and things like that.


SEAN CASTEN:
No, I agree, but where are they offloading that risk to?


JEROME POWELL:
I mean --


SEAN CASTEN:
If -- if they're putting -- we've seen them putting it onto Fannie and Freddie. We've seen Fannie and Freddie try to put it onto the reinsurance industry. The risk doesn't go up.


ROGER WILLIAMS:
The gentleman's time is up.


JEROME POWELL:
We don't regulate them.


ROGER WILLIAMS:
The gentleman's time is up.


SEAN CASTEN:
I yield back.


ROGER WILLIAMS:
Next, the gentlewoman from the great state of Missouri, Congressman Wagner is now recognized for five minutes.


ANN WAGNER:
I thank you, Mr. Chairman and in keeping with the baseball analogies here, I think I'm batting cleanup. Uh, Chairman Powell, welcome in this afternoon to you. Uh, Chair Powell, in your testimony, you stated that, and I quote, "longer term inflation expectations appear to remain well anchored." Could you please expand on that for us?


JEROME POWELL:
Sure, so in our thinking and the thinking of economists and central bankers, what the public expects about inflation is really important. Because if you expect there to be low inflation, then it probably will be low because you're going to -- you're going to make sure that's true in your daily decisions, so we measure them.

We -- you know, we survey individuals and businesses and market participants.


ANN WAGNER:
OK.


JEROME POWELL:
And then we look at market based. You can -- you can also derive market estimates of what inflation will be through various instruments in the markets. And all of those suggest that people expect inflation to be right around two percent over the longer term. And that's been very stable right through this episode.


ANN WAGNER:
When you say longer term, sir, how many years would you be estimating? One year, three year, five year, is there any -- ?


JEROME POWELL:
So we look at -- we look at short -- short and medium term inflation expectations too. And they tend to be more volatile. Because you know, when inflation is high, people think that will last a few years. But one standard thing is to look at five year, five year. Which is between year five and year ten. That's a standard way to look or longer term than that.

Um, if you ask -- you just ask people in surveys over the longer term, you maybe don't specify, but they all give you the same answer, which is people kind of have faith that inflation will go back down to its two percent level.


ANN WAGNER:
Thank you. Um, there has been some reporting lately on shrinkflation. And for our viewers, I'll say this is when you pay the same price for something as yesterday, but get less of it than before. Kind of like my bag of potato chips. Um, some have sought to direct attention away from the pain of runaway inflation that we've experienced and instead blame producers who themselves face rising costs and pressures.

Yet, I haven't seen any mention of shrinkflation as an inflation cause in any recent monetary policy report. Moreover, a Bureau of Labor Statistics article last year looked at shrinkflation and concluded that, and I quote again, "it has a minuscule impact on overall inflation." Chair Powell, from the Fed's perspective and analysis has shrinkflation been a significant uh, casual or amplifying factor in the runaway inflation of the past several years that has imposed maybe greater pain on American workers and households?


JEROME POWELL:
I have to say no. I mean, we -- I would say it this way, you know, you -- packaging in the US in -- on food products and that kind of thing, you know, it's going to disclose the -- the contents of the thing. And the price will be what it is. And consumers can make their choice to buy it or not. But uh, but we don't think that's a -- we don't think that's a major driver of inflation, no.


ANN WAGNER:
I think from a producer standpoint, it probably is, if the cost of the -- of -- of the -- of the item uh, is -- is exponentially higher --


JEROME POWELL:
It may reflect costs on the -- on the part of the producer. It probably does. But that doesn't mean it's a cause of inflation as such.


ANN WAGNER:
OK. Thank you. So switching topics, the Federal Reserve has produced volumes of research over the last decade highlighting the negative consequences of the debit interchange fee cap. Some of the economists who produced that research has -- have even worked on this proposed rule, the Reg II. Chair Powell, was the previous Federal Reserve research demonstrating regulation II's detrimental impacts to low cost checking accounts flawed?

Or did it have incorrect conclusions? And if not, then why would the Fed propose this rulemaking when all of their research demonstrated detrimental impacts, please?


JEROME POWELL:
I am not entirely sure what research you're referring to. I'll be happy to follow up with you on that.


ANN WAGNER:
Yeah, I hope you are. Because I know we're having this discussion about the interchange fee caps and -- and Reg II. And I'm concerned about going forward on that when much of the -- of the research that we have seen from the Fed, and it's been pretty steady over -- over the last number of years, um, says it has quite detrimental impacts.

So please to low cost checking, and so if you -- if you don't -- wouldn't mind, I would love to get some answers on that. And also, why hasn't the Fed taken into action the higher fraud costs that debit card issuers will incur as a result of the new dual routing mandate for card not present transactions?

I'm over my time. If you could also um answer in writing, I would be ever so grateful. I yield back, sir.


ROGER WILLIAMS:
Thank you. The lady yields back and I would like to thank Chairman Powell for his testimony today. I know you've got to get out of here. And without objection, all members will have five legislative days to submit additional written questions for the witness to the chair. The questions will be forwarded to the witnesses for his response.

And I ask you Chairman Powell to please respond no later than August 30th, 2024. With that in mind, this hearing is adjourned.

###
下院金融委員会が金融政策報告書に関する公聴会を開催
委員会メンバーおよび参考人リスト

パトリック・メンリー
委員会を開会します。異議なく、議長はいつでも委員会の休会を宣言する権限を有する。公聴会のタイトルは「連邦準備制度理事会（FRB）の半期金融政策報告書」です。ここでは独創的なタイトルを付けたいのですが、これはハンフリー・ホーキンス氏の伝統的なタイトルです。異議なく、すべてのメンバーは5立法日以内に、記録に含めるために議長に余分な資料を提出することができます。

この公聴会には午後1時というハードストップがあることを最初にお断りしておきます。それでは、冒頭陳述を4分間とさせていただきます。パウエル議長、本日はありがとうございます。バイデン大統領の就任以来、物価は20％以上上昇しており、インフレはアメリカの家庭にとって依然として最大の関心事です。

実際、ギャラップ社の経済信頼感指数の最新データによれば、現在の経済状況を「良い」または「素晴らしい」と評価するアメリカ人は全体の4分の1に過ぎない。バイデン大統領のガス抜きにもかかわらず、彼が大統領に就任した当時、インフレ率は9％ではなかった。現在我々が経験している制御不能のインフレは、この政権が引き継いだものではなく、彼らの政策と過剰支出の産物なのだ。

アメリカン・レスキュー・プランの一環として行われた2兆ドル近い党派的かつ財政的に無謀な支出は、くすぶり続けるインフレの火に油を注いだ。インフレ暴走への対応が遅れた後、FOMCは民主党の経済政策の失敗による痛みを和らげるため、歴史的なペースで利上げに踏み切った。

実際の病気ではなく、対応策なのだ。FRBはこの炎を鎮めようとしているが、それはここ議会と政権における民主党の政策に対する反応なのだ。今年これまでのところ、インフレはFRBを含む多くの人々が予想していた以上に続いている。FRBの目標である2％を達成するためには、まだやるべきことがある。

何度も申し上げているように、FRBは -- 私は -- 連邦準備制度理事会（FRB）の独立性へのコミットメントが最も重要だと考えており、特に今年のような政治的な年には極めて重要だ。パウエル議長、以前の政権でそうであったように、政治がFRBの金融政策を曇らせるようなことがあってはならない。

しかし、あなたの最善の努力にもかかわらず、FRBの独立性は依然として危機に瀕しており、残念なことに、その声は内部からも上がっている。バー副議長の下で、FRBの規制・監督アジェンダは政治化した。特にバーゼルIII最終案の策定は混乱した。

このプロセスは、説明責任のないグローバル・ガバナンス機関の会議で設定された不透明な基準とスケジュールに覆われている。FRBは、不当で十分に活用されていない初期案、あるいは十分に分析されていない初期案に関して、410件ものほとんど普遍的に否定的なコメント、パブリックコメントを処理すると約束している。

最近の報道は、議会がバーゼルIIIの最終的な進捗状況について詳細を知る唯一の方法であるように思われ、また昨日の皆さんのコメントは、FRBがついに長年の懸案であった定量的影響調査を実施することを示している。それは歓迎すべきことだ。もしそれが本当なら、これは有望な、将来性のある展開です。パウエル議長、前回当委員会で証言された際には、バーゼルIIIの最終段階における最初の提案には「広範かつ重大な変更」が加えられると述べられました。昨日、上院であなたは、理事会はパブリックコメントのために更新案を再発行することを支持すると述べました。


パトリック・メンリー
報道では、FRBはこの定量的影響調査に提案のいかなる変更も盛り込むとされているが、私は懸念している。提案の大幅な変更を含むこの調査は、その後、比較的わずかなコメント期間付きでパブリック・フィードバックのために公表されるでしょう。この場で、私が内輪で申し上げたことを繰り返そう。バーゼルIIIの最終目標に対する広範かつ重大な変更には、全面的な再提案が必要である。

それができなければ、議会審査法の採決が下院で行われることになる。FRBが長年の原則を守ることは、特にこの省庁間プロセスにおいて非常に重要だと思います。

最後に、こう申し上げたい。連邦準備制度理事会（FRB）に対するあなたの着実で有能な非政治的リーダーシップは、極度の不確実性の中で私たちの経済を導いてきた。今、私たちは、わが国の指導部を取り巻く新しいタイプの不確実性の真っ只中にいます。疑念、恐怖、パニックは、しばしば誤った意思決定やさらに悪い政策につながる。

私は、この不安定な時期に外部からの政治的圧力を拒絶し、米国民と経済全体のために道を踏み外さないことを強く求めます。ご苦労様でした。これより4分間、ウォーターズ委員を指名します。


マキシン・ウォーターズ
委員長、どうもありがとうございました。連邦準備制度理事会（FRB）議長、ジェローム・H・パウエル氏におかえりなさい。パウエル議長、最新の雇用統計に見られるように、労働市場は依然として力強く、景気は急上昇しています。大恐慌以来最悪の雇用記録を残した前政権から経済を引き継いだにもかかわらず、バイデン大統領は就任以来、記録的な1,570万人の雇用創出を監督し、先月は20万6,000人の新規雇用が創出されたばかりです。

それだけでなく、バイデン政権下では、低失業率、賃金上昇、商品やサービスの価格安定を目の当たりにしている。これはバイデン大統領の強力なリーダーシップによるものだけでなく、バイデン大統領が署名した歴史的な法案が、コスト削減、雇用創出、インフラ再建、中小企業支援、ジャンク料金の大半の撤廃、1,400万人の借り手に対する1,440億ドル以上の連邦学生ローン債務の一掃、子どもの貧困の半減をもたらしたからである。

バイデン大統領は、高賃金の雇用と、すべての人のために機能する経済を提供する政策を進めており、今後もそれを継続していくだろう。インフレ率が低下していることは喜ばしいことですが、最新のデータでは、住宅価格が依然としてコア・インフレの最大の要因であることが明らかになっています。2020年以降、住宅価格は50％近く上昇し、アメリカ人は平均して収入の30％以上を住宅に費やしている。

これは民主党にとっては最優先事項だが、共和党にとっては後回しにされたままだ。今議会に入り、私は住宅危機対応法を含む包括的な住宅支援法案を再提出した。この法案は、公正で手ごろな住宅への投資に1,500億ドル以上を提供するもので、わが国の歴史上、手ごろな住宅への投資としては唯一最大のものである。

これらの資金により、140万戸近い手頃な価格の利用しやすい住宅が建設され、すべての人の住宅コストが引き下げられ、持ち家というアメリカン・ドリームが復活することになる。委員会民主党は、この法案を最後までやり遂げることを約束し、共和党の同僚が最終的にこの取り組みに参加してくれることを期待し続けている。

残念ながら、極端なマガ共和党は住宅インフレを無視するだけでなく、米国の民主主義と現在の経済を解体する「プロジェクト2025」マニフェストを推進している。プロジェクト2025」は、トランプ・ホワイトハウスの元スタッフやトランプ政権高官ら20人近くが執筆している。

超極右のヘリテージ財団が編集・出版したもので、そのCEOは最近、「第二次アメリカ革命の過程にある。そして、このような話が、2020年1月6日に向けて、またその日に向けて我々が耳にしたレトリックを思い起こさせるとしたら、そうであるべきだろう。

プロジェクト2025は、連邦準備制度を事実上廃止しないまでも、実質的に弱体化させる急進的な考えを推進している。MAGAは、パウエル議長を失業させようとしている。そこで、私はあなたの証言と、トランプ大統領によって最初に指名された共和党員であるあなたから、連邦準備制度理事会の重要性に対するあなたの考えと、私たちの経済を助けるためにあなたが行ってきた仕事について聞くことを楽しみにしています。

それではお先に失礼します。


パトリック・メンリー
ジェントルレディが降伏します。ジェローム・パウエルは当初、オバマ大統領によって連邦準備制度理事会に指名され、その後トランプ大統領によって議長に指名されました。では、ここで 金融機関小委員会の委員長、アンディ・バーことバー氏を1分間認めます。


アンディ・バーです：
ありがとうございます、委員長。ようこそ、パウエル議長。暴走するインフレと、それに立ち向かうために必要な金利の上昇は、アメリカ人、特に給料をもらいながら生活している人々に打撃を与え続けています。労働者やその家族は、食料品売り場や給油所で高値で日々の買い物をすることに苦痛を感じている。

バイデン政権の経済失政のもとで、彼らは長年にわたって給料の購買力の低下に苦しんできた。住宅ローン金利の高騰は、新規住宅購入者が家族のためのスターター・ホームというアメリカン・ドリームを手に入れることを困難にしている。FRBがインフレ抑制に断固として取り組んでいることを喜ばしく思う。

FRBが非政治的なアプローチに取り組んでいることを嬉しく思う。私は、FRBが不透明で、不当で、政治的で、分析不足の規制案を出していることを喜ばしく思っていません。私たちは、根本的に欠陥のあるバーゼルIIIの最終案とその不透明な規制アプローチについて、FRBがどこへ行こうとしているのかを知る必要があります。

以上


パトリック・メンリー
では、議長から金融機関金融政策小委員会のフォスター委員に1分間の発言をお願いします。


ビル・フォスター
マクヘンリー委員長、ウォーターズ委員、ありがとうございます。また、パウエル議長におかれましては、本日のご出席と、インフレ対策と安定した景気回復を支えてこられた役割に感謝申し上げます。マクロ経済情勢に関する政治的発表の焦点は大統領職にあることが多いが、連邦準備制度理事会（FRB）の業務の重要性と独立性が過小評価されていることに疑問の余地はない。

大統領や議会が取る行動も確かに重要な役割を果たすが、独立した連邦準備制度理事会（FRB）が下す金融政策の決定は、何百万人ものアメリカ人の経済的な成果を形作るマクロ経済状況を形成する大きな犬である。インフレ率の改善には引き続き取り組んでいるが、FRBが目標とする2%に近づけるために大きな進展があった。

良いニュースは、マクロ経済政策が設計通りに機能していることだ。アメリカン・レスキュー・プラン、インフラ・雇用法、CHIPS・科学法などの財政支援とうまく調整された金融政策が、強力な雇用創出と低失業率の原動力となり、多くの人々が避けられないと考えていた景気後退を食い止めるとともに、同業諸国に比べてはるかに良好であることを指摘しておきます。

お先に失礼します。


パトリック・メンリー
それでは、ジェローム・パウエル第16代連邦準備制度理事会（FRB）議長の証言をお願いします。パウエル議長、あなたの証言の口頭発表を5分間認めます。異議がなければ、あなたの書面陳述は記録の一部となります。パウエル議長の証言時間は5分です。


ジェローム・パウエル
マクヘンリー委員長、ウォーターズ委員、その他の委員の皆様、連邦準備制度理事会（FRB）の半期金融政策報告書を発表する機会をいただき、感謝いたします。米連邦準備制度理事会（FRB）は、米国民の利益のために最大限の雇用と安定した物価を促進するという、我々の二重の使命に引き続き焦点を合わせている。

過去2年間、経済は連邦準備制度理事会（FRB）が目標とする2％のインフレ率に向けて大きく前進し、労働市場の状況は堅調を維持しながらも冷え込んでいる。こうした動きを反映して、雇用とインフレの目標達成に向けたリスクは、より良いバランスに戻りつつある。

金融政策に目を向ける前に、現在の経済状況を振り返っておこう。最近の指標は、米国経済が引き続き堅調なペースで拡大していることを示唆している。国内総生産の伸びは、昨年後半の目覚しい力強さに続き、今年前半は緩やかになっているようだ。

しかし、民間の内需は依然として堅調で、個人消費は鈍化しているものの、依然として堅調な伸びを示している。設備投資も緩やかな伸びを示し、住宅投資も持ち直した。供給環境の改善が、昨年来の底堅い需要と米国経済の好調を支えてきた。

労働市場では、広範な指標から、状況はパンデミック（世界的大流行）前夜とほぼ同じ水準に戻ったことが示唆される。失業率は上昇に転じたが、6月はまだ4.1％の低水準だった。今年上半期の雇用者数は月平均22万2,000人増加した。

ここ数年の力強い雇用創出は、25歳から54歳までの労働力人口の増加と移民の増加ペースを反映した労働者供給の増加を伴っている。その結果、雇用と労働者の格差はピークから大幅に縮小し、現在は2019年の水準を少し上回る程度である。

名目賃金の伸びはこの1年で鈍化した。堅調な労働市場により、雇用と所得における長年の各層間格差が縮小している。インフレ率はここ数年で顕著に緩和したが、委員会の長期目標である2％を依然上回っている。PCE価格は5月までの12ヵ月間に2.6%上昇した。変動しやすい食品とエネルギーのカテゴリーを除いたコアPCE価格も2.6%上昇した。

今年の初めにはインフレ目標2%に向けた進展が見られませんでしたが、最近の月次指標では緩やかな進展が見られました。長期的なインフレ期待は、家計、企業、予測担当者を対象とした広範な調査や金融市場の指標に反映されているように、依然として十分に固定されているようだ。

私たちの金融政策行動は、米国民のために最大限の雇用と安定した物価を促進するという、私たちの二重の使命に導かれている。これらの目標を支えるため、委員会は昨年7月以来、フェデラルファンド金利の目標レンジを5.25～5.5%に維持してきた。

また、保有有価証券の削減も続けてきた。我々は5月の会合で、以前に発表した計画に沿って、6月からバランスシートの縮小ペースを緩めることを決定した。私たちの制限的な金融政策スタンスは、需要と供給のバランスを改善し、インフレに下方圧力をかけるのに役立っている。

当委員会は、インフレ率が持続的に2%に向かっているという確信が得られるまで、フェデラルファンド金利の目標レンジを引き下げることは適切ではないと考えている。今年第1四半期のデータは、そのような確信を裏付けるものではなかった。

しかし、直近のインフレ指標は緩やかな前進を示しており、インフレ率が持続的に2%に向かっているという確信がさらに強まるだろう。我々は引き続き、会合ごとに意思決定を行っていく。私たちは、政策抑制を早急に、あるいは過度に縮小すれば、インフレ率に関するこれまでの進展を停滞させ、あるいは逆行させる可能性があることを知っています。

同時に、過去2年間におけるインフレ率の低下と労働市場の冷え込みの進展に鑑みれば、インフレ率の上昇は我々が直面する唯一のリスクではない。政策抑制の縮小が遅すぎたり少なすぎたりすれば、経済活動や雇用を不当に弱める可能性がある。フェデラル・ファンド金利の目標レンジの調整を検討する際、委員会は引き続き、入ってくるデータと、それが進展する見通し、リスクのバランス、金融政策の適切な道筋に与える影響を注意深く評価する。

議会はFRBに、最大限の雇用と物価の安定という2つのマンデートを追求する上で、長期的な視野に立つために必要な運営上の独立性を託している。FRBは引き続き、インフレ率を2％の目標まで低下させ、長期的なインフレ期待を適切に維持することに全力を注ぐ。

物価安定の回復は、最大限の雇用と長期的な物価安定の達成に不可欠である。こうした目標を達成するための我々の成功は、すべてのアメリカ国民にとって重要である。最後に、私たちの行動が全米の地域社会、家族、ビジネスに影響を与えることを理解していることを強調します。私たちの行動はすべて、公的使命のためにあるのです。

ありがとうございました。ご質問をお待ちしています。


パトリック・メンリー
パウエル議長、ありがとうございます。それでは、5分間だけ自認させていただきます。パウエル議長、まずバーゼルIIIの最終目標についてお聞かせください。昨日も質問がありましたが、さらに明確にする必要があると思います。バー副議長がFDICおよびOCCとバーゼルIIIの最終段階に関する次のステップについて協議したことについての証言では、当初のバーゼルIIIの最終段階に潜在的な変更が加えられたこと、多くの進展があったこと、そして理事会がその変更の内容で合意するのに非常に近づいていることが述べられています。

しかし、次のステップに入りたいと思います。次に何が起こるのか、そのメカニズムを説明しよう。FRB、OCC、FDICが、あなたが行おうとしている変更の中身に合意したら、それからどうなるのですか？どのような仕組みになるのでしょうか？


ジェローム・パウエル
その協議に基づき、提案された変更の内容について、まさに合意に近づいています。次の問題は、どのように進めるかだ。私の見解でもあり、また多くの理事会メンバーの強い見解でもあるのですが、適切なのは、この新しい提案を、量的影響調査の効果とともに公表し、再度コメントを募集して、それに対するコメントを受け、規制を最終決定する前に、そのコメントを検討する時間をとることです。

現在、他の2つの機関と話し合っているところです。しかし、それが正しい方法だと考えています。同じような状況では、私たちはそうしてきた。

しかし、重要な規則がより大きく変更されるような場合には、もう一度、すべての意見提出者に意見を述べる機会を与えようと考えています。


パトリック・メンリー
そうすれば、深刻な訴訟リスクや、議会が介入して議会審査法を使ってこの規則制定が覆されるリスクも回避できます。もし他の機関がFRBに同意しないのであれば、連邦準備制度理事会の独立性に反することになると思います。これは政策の些細な問題ではありません。

連邦準備制度理事会の独立性と、連邦準備制度理事会の規則制定に関わる、実質的な問題なのです。連邦準備制度理事会（FRB）の独立性は、特にこの政治的環境においては、維持されるべきです。しかし、新たなコメント期間を設けるということは、政策について理事会のコンセンサスを得なければならないということです。

スキャンダルにまみれたFDICの理事長や、5人の理事から合意を得なければならない。通貨監督官代理の同意も得なければならない。特にFDICの委員長は、後任が決まり次第、自民党によって更迭されようとしている。

FRBが通貨監督庁長官代理や、FDICですぐに職を失いそうな人物のところに行って合意を得なければならないなんて、とんでもないことだ。でも聞いてくれてありがとう。今のはどちらかというと......これを伝えるためです。定量的影響分析にはストレステストとの関連も含まれるのですか？

GSIBサーチャージ、その他すべての資本賦課金も定量的影響度分析に含まれるのでしょうか？


ジェローム・パウエル
GSIBサーチャージの変更は含まれますが、ストレステストは含まれません。


パトリック・メンリー
しかし、定量的影響分析の目的は、制定されたこれらの規則の影響を実際に測定することです。既存の規制構造に基づいています。わかりました。


ジェローム・パウエル：
その通りです


パトリック・メンリー
わかりました。では、できるだけ早くバランスシートの問題に入りましょう。あなたは2年半前に、「委員会は、準備残高が十分な準備と一致すると判断する水準をいくらか上回った時点で、バランスシートの縮小を減速させ、その後停止させるつもりである」と述べました。十分な準備とは何なのか？


ジェローム・パウエル
さて、バランスシートですが、現在、ポートフォリオが1.7兆ドルになっていると思います。ですから、かなり前進しています。まだ道半ばだと考えています。そして、今申し上げたように、また今お話にあったように、私たちは、早々に縮小を止めてしまうような摩擦や混乱を引き起こすことなく、できる限りのことを行うために、ペースを落としています。

もう少しペースを落とせば、さらに前進できるかもしれない。まだ道半ばだと考えている。それを正確に言うのは非常に難しい。本当に需給の問題であり、私たちはそのレベルを見つけ、その上に少しバッファーを置いて、そこで止めることになるでしょう。


パトリック・メンリー
証言ありがとうございました。それでは、ランキング・メンバーのウォーターズさんに5分間の発言をお願いします。


マキシン・ウォーターズ：
ありがとうございます。パウエル議長、プロジェクト2025をご存知ですか？


ジェローム・パウエル：
そうではありません


いいえ：
お聞きになったことはありますか？


ジェローム・パウエル：
私はこのようなことには 全く関心がありません


集中してない
しかし、プロジェクト2025というものがあることはご存知でしょう。なぜ私があなたに質問しているかというと、FRBの二重の使命である物価の安定だけでなく、最大限の雇用を促進することを廃止しようという提案があるからです。これがあなたのマンデートです。これは義務ですよね？これがFRBの使命でしょう？


ジェローム・パウエル
私たちは二重の使命を果たしています。


マキシン・ウォーターズ：
その通りです。では、もし強制力をなくすようなことがあれば、それは私たちの経済や国に何をもたらすでしょうか？


ジェローム・パウエル：
どのような義務を果たすかという問題は、議会にとって非常に重要な問題です。私たちは......私自身の見解では、二重のマンデートは私たちによく役立ってきた。これは議会が変更し、単一の任務に戻すことができるものだ。しかし...


マキシン・ウォーターズ：
-- 最大限の雇用を得るためにはどうすればいいのか？どうするのですか？


ジェローム・パウエル：
そうですね、私たちは基本的に経済に対して一つの手段を持っていて、それは金利を上げたり下げたりすることです。金利を上げたり下げたりすることです。しかし、いずれにせよ、私たちFRBは、二重のマンデートが良いことだと信じています。


マキシン・ウォーターズ
もちろん、あなたはプロジェクト2025を見たり聞いたり読んだりしたことはないでしょうが、ダイバーシティ＆インクルージョンをなくそうという国の取り組みについてはご存知ですか？


ジェローム・パウエル
しかし、正直なところ、私たちは最大限の雇用と物価の安定という課題に集中している。ご存知のように、私たちはFRBにおける多様性を強く支持しています。


マキシン・ウォーターズ
私がこの委員会に多様性と雇用に関する小委員会を設けたことはご存知ですか？


ジェローム・パウエル：
はい、覚えています。


覚えています
多様性と雇用を取り除くことは、最大限の雇用を実現する能力を妨げると思いますか？


ジェローム・パウエル：
私は......私は......私はキャリアの大半を民間企業で過ごしましたが、私が観察したところ、米国で本当に成功している機関、企業、組織は一般的に、多様性に関して本当に良い仕事をし、人々の能力を最大限に引き出しているものです。そして広く多様な才能を引き寄せる。

そして、人々は安心して話すことができる。FRBではそのように考えていますし、これまでもそうしてきましたし、これからもそうしていくつもりです。


マキシン・ウォーターズ
公共部門だけでなく、民間部門でも多様性と包摂が重要だとお考えですか？


ジェローム・パウエル：
そうですね。今申し上げたように、成功しているアメリカ企業を見ると、多様な人材を採用し、惹きつけ、投資し、維持することに長けていることがよくわかります。これは、本当に優れたアメリカの上場企業がうまくやっていることのひとつです。


マキシン・ウォーターズ
あなたの在任中に、多様性とインクルージョンがより多くの雇用の機会を生み出し、失業率を低下させるような改善が見られましたか？


ジェローム・パウエル
私の長いキャリアの中で、ダイバーシティとインクルージョンが大きく変化したことは確かです。それは一般的に進歩だと思います。私はそう思います。


マキシン・ウォーターズ：
この委員会と小委員会はビーティさんが委員長を務めていますが、彼女は民間部門で何が起こっているのかについて重要なデータを集めることができました。そして彼女が発見したのは、CEOをはじめとする多くの人々が、より多くを学び、より良い結果を出し、支援を受ける機会を歓迎しているということだった。

そして私たちは、ダイバーシティとインクルージョン（多様性と包括性）の改善を目の当たりにしたのです。あなたはそれを見たことがありますか？


ジェローム・パウエル
CEOたちに話を聞けば、彼らはこれを理解している。今、わが国で最高の人材を惹きつけたいのであれば、これらのことに取り組む必要があります。


マキシン・ウォーターズ
あなたのこれまでの仕事ぶりを褒めたいと思います。インフレについて私たちに情報を提供してくれていることを褒めたいと思います。今日ここに来ていただいたことを歓迎するだけでなく、これから何年も一緒に働けることを楽しみにしています。お先に失礼します。ありがとう


ジェローム・パウエル
ありがとう


パトリック・メンリー
アーカンソー州選出の紳士、 全委員会の副議長、 ヒル氏の 発言を5分間認めます


フレンチ・ヒル：
議長に感謝いたします。パウエル議長。ありがとうございます。ティム・スコット上院議員とマクヘンリー委員長の話を引き継ぎ、バーゼルIIIの最終案を再提案する必要性について、昨日上院で表明されたあなたのコメントを改めて強く支持したいと思います。最高裁の判例は、規則が提案から最終規則へと広範かつ重大な変更を受ける場合、その変更について国民が検討しコメントする有意義な機会を与えなければならないことを明確にしていると思います。

あなたは一般的にその見解を共有していると思いますが、そうでしょうか？


ジェローム・パウエル
そうです。


そうです：
ドッド・フランク法の監督担当副議長、バー副議長の役割とFRBの役割のために、昨日あなたが言及された省庁間合意と同様に、定量的影響調査の結果と個別のコメント期間を見るのを楽しみにしています。FRBはこのようなルールの提案において対等な立場にあると言えるのでしょうか。

言い換えれば、FRBはこの規則を完全に再提案すべきかどうかの判断において優位な立場にあるのでしょうか。その点についての見解をお聞かせください。


ジェローム・パウエル
バー副議長が実際に行っているFDICやOCCとの話し合いは、これまでのところ非常に生産的なものです。ですから、私たちはこの問題を解決するために努力を続けており、かなり近いうちに、残されたプロセスの問題を解決できると信じています。


フレンチ・ヒル
よかった。さて、その話題から、いわゆるシェブロン・ドクトリンを覆す裁判所の最近の判決に話を移させてください。私たちの多くは、これが文字通り数十年にわたる行政国家の前例のない無秩序な拡大を抑制する第一歩だと考えています。ですから、少なくともこちら側の私たち全員が、連邦準備制度理事会（FRB）をはじめとする連邦政府機関に対し、私たちの管轄下にある独立した機関が機能する方向性について、第1条の権限を再び主張したいと申し上げているのは確かだと思います。

今回のシェブロンの変更により、連邦準備制度理事会（FRB）は、議会の明確な認可に基づく場合のみ、新たな規則を公布することを約束することになりますが、そのことを証明するよう、あなたにお願いしてもよろしいでしょうか？


ジェローム・パウエル
まず第一に、私たちはこの件と、ここ1、2週間で下された他のいくつかの判決を研究しているところです。だから、それについて明確なことは何もわかっていない。私たちが法の支配に強くコミットしている組織であることは、皆さんもご存知だと思う。

最高裁は法律が何であるかを言っていますが、私たちは常に法律が何であるかを信じて行動します。


フレンチ・ヒル
さて、その質問については、もう少し詳しく文章にして提出します。月にあなたは60ミニッツに出演し、米国の財政赤字と国家債務は持続不可能だと言いました。米国が持続不可能な財政の道を歩んでいるという見方は変わりませんか？


ジェローム・パウエル
そうです。ですから、私は......米国の債務水準そのものが持続不可能というわけではなく、私たちが歩んでいる道は持続不可能だということを明確にしようとしたのだと思います。


フレンチ・ヒル
財政赤字が経済成長率の3倍にも膨れ上がり、それがインフレを助長していることは懸念材料です。ちょうど3年前、ワイオミング州のジャクソンホールで、あなたはインフレは一過性のものだと確信しているようなスピーチをされました。

今回の公聴会は、金融政策決定について謙虚さを示す絶好の機会であり、特にこちら側の一部の人々は、インフレを悪化させたと考えている。2020年8月のジャクソンホールでの講演では、2％というフレキシブルな平均インフレ目標の枠組みについて、2％以上のインフレを許容すると述べました。

FRBはこれまでの20年間、デフレをもたらす世界的な変化に目を奪われていたのでしょうか？


ジェローム・パウエル
中立金利はかなり低下しているに違いない。それが標準的な見方でした。私たちが予想していなかったのは、パンデミック（世界的大流行）です。すべてが狂ったわけではありません。

パンデミックに見舞われ、経済のあり方が大きく変わってしまったのです。私たちは大きな危機を迎えた。私たちは多くのことを行った。ですから、私たちを導いた懸念は......超低金利の世界にずっといるという懸念です。


フレンチ・ヒル
しかし今は、リショアリングや関税、その他の政策がインフレを引き起こしているという、まったく逆の状況にあると言えるのではないでしょうか？


ジェローム・パウエル
そうですね......まあ、私が言いたいのは、そうした懸念は、今現在、政策金利が5％台半ばにあるということです。そして......私たちは、政策が制限的であるとは見ていません。しかし、少なくとも短期的には中立金利は上昇しているはずです。ですから、今年末に始まるレビューでは、このことを自問自答することになると思います。


フレンチ・ヒル
-- 私たちはそれを楽しみにしています。議長に戻ります --


ジェローム・パウエル：
-- その時期にわれわれがやったことのうち、どれだけのことが、金利が上昇しているように見える新しい世界と無関係なのかということです。


パトリック・メンリー
ジョージア州出身のスコット氏に5分間の発言を認めます。




デービッド・スコットです：
議長、ありがとうございます。お会いできてうれしいです。前回お会いしたときには、私のオフィスを訪ねていただき、いろいろなお話をさせていただきました。ありがとうございました。さて、今年FRBが検査した銀行は昨年の23行から31行に増えましたね？


ジェローム・パウエル
その通りだと思います。


そうです：
そして、仮想的なストレス・シナリオのもとで、損失、収益、費用、資本水準を推定したわけですね？


ジェローム・パウエル：
そうです。


そうです：
その結果、31行すべてが6,850億ドル近い損失を計上した後も、最低限必要な普通株式Tier1資本を上回っていました。それは正しいですか？


ジェローム・パウエル：
はい、その通りです。


そうです：
バー副議長がこのような発言をしましたので、国民と共有したいと思います。この偉大な業績からの正確な引用を記録に残したいと思います。私は、この発言は素晴らしいものだと思いました。

2024年のFRBのストレステストの結果は、プルデンシャル規制当局が新しい資本案を発表する際に影響を与えるのでしょうか？


ジェローム・パウエル
この2つは本当に異なるものです。バーゼルIIIの資本案とストレステストです。バーゼルIIIについては、先ほど申し上げたように、重要かつ広範な変更を加えた修正案を提出し、コメントを求める準備がほぼ整いました。ストレステストは別物です。

もちろん、ストレステストは試したし、時間をかけて適応させ、変更を受け入れる必要があることも理解している。しかし、これはバーゼルIIIの最終目標とは別のものです。


DAVID SCOTT：
バーゼルIIIについてもう少し詳しく教えてください。私たちの仕事は、オバマ政権が銀行危機に対応したときまでさかのぼります。そして、失業率が高く、同時に住宅差し押さえが多発し、苦しんでいる州を支援するために、私たちはハーデスト・ヒット・プログラムを立ち上げました。

しかし、私たちの活動の結果、世界中で起こっていることもお伝えしたいと思います。欧州連合（EU）は銀行の資本規制の主要部分を1年以上延期することにしており、これによりEUの指導者たち、つまり金融機関は不利な立場に立たされることはない。カナダでは、銀行規制当局が自国の銀行に高い資本規制を課すことを1年延期した。

スイス国立銀行は、UPSをはじめとするスイスの銀行に対し、15％の自己資本規制案を採用する可能性は極めて低い。イングランド銀行は、英国の銀行の自己資本を3.2％増加させるという最終案に近い案を発表した。これはすべて、あなたと副議長の素晴らしい仕事の賜物だと思います。

それについてコメントをお願いします。


ジェローム・パウエル：
私たちはこの提案の最終化に全力を尽くしています。銀行は長い長い間、この規則と付き合っていくことになります。私たちは、最終的に何をするのか。最終的に私たちが行うことは、バーゼル協定と整合的なものになるでしょうし、他の大規模な法域が行っていることとも整合的なものになるでしょう。


DAVID SCOTT：
これからも頑張ってください。


パトリック・メンリー
ペンシルベニア州からお越しのミーサー氏に5分間お話をお願いします。


ダニエル・ミーサーです：
ありがとうございます。議長、パウエル議長、また、経済全体を見渡すとのご指示に感謝いたします。感謝いたします。最近、国内最大手の銀行がメモの中で警告を発しましたが、中小の銀行からも、資本要件の変更やデビットカードのインターチェンジ・キャップの引き下げなど、現在の規制のペースでは、当座預金口座に関連する新たな手数料が発生する可能性があるとの声が上がっています。

その他、中小企業にとってはコスト増となる。これは、研究開発税額控除や利子控除、ボーナス減価償却など、中小企業にとって重要な税制条項が期限切れとなるなかでのことである。このような規制や増税が、インフレ率2％を達成するという閣僚の使命に対して、どのように直接作用するのか考えているのだろうか？

さらに、バーゼルIIIの変更案については、すべての利害関係者がこのプロセスで発言できるようにすることが極めて重要であり、バーゼルの再提案や十分なコメント期間が設けられることは大歓迎です。パウエル委員長、昨日上院で、バーゼルIIIの再提案を行い、コメント期間を設けるというのが理事会の多数意見であるとおっしゃいました。

これは、バーゼルⅢをゼロから再提案するという意味なのでしょうか。


ジェローム・パウエル
まだ合意には至っていません。先ほど申し上げたように、私たちはFDICやOCCの同僚と一緒にこの件に取り組んでいます。具体的にどのような形になるかは申し上げられません。ただ、私たちが重要な変更を加えようとしていること、そして、その変更を量的影響調査に照らして国民に見てもらい、それについてコメントするための適切な時間を設けたいと考えていることは確かです。

そのうえで、私たちはひとつの大きな分野に焦点を絞っていますが、各方面からコメントを寄せている機関もあり、私たちはそれらをすべて注意深く読んでいます。だから、それは......とても手間のかかる時間のかかる作業になる。

こういうものを書き上げるには長い時間がかかる。


DANIEL MEUSER：
いいですね。それは素晴らしい。カナダは最近、EUやイギリスと同様に、国際競争の観点から延期しました。それはありがたいことです。議長、過度な支出、増税、国内エネルギー生産の制限は、原則として、企業にとってコスト上昇の原因となり、インフレの一因となり、また、労働市場を引き締め、あなたの2つの使命に反することに同意されますか？


ジェローム・パウエル
政治的な質問をしているようなものだ。私たちが決めることではない経済財政政策を批判するつもりはありません。


DANIEL MEUSER：
それは経済的な質問ですが、ご回答ありがとうございます。昨日の上院公聴会で政策の再調整に言及したのは、経済状況をより総合的にとらえるという考え方の一環だったのですか？


ジェローム・パウエル
そうです。


そうです：
わかりました。わかりました 会長、いわゆる貪欲インフレを裏付けるデータはありますか？その発言を裏付けるデータはありますか？


ジェローム・パウエル：
私たちは、インフレは非常に強い需要と制約された供給の組み合わせによって引き起こされたと考えています。つまり、再開した経済が高速で衝突したのだ。しかし同時に、例えば自動車のような旺盛な需要があった一方で、半導体が十分でなかったために供給が制約された。

しかし、私たちにとっては、これがインフレなのです。私たちは、供給側の回復を観察してきました。同時に、制限的な金融政策が需要に重くのしかかり、インフレ率は低下しています。


DANIEL MEUSER：
つまり、消費者への暴利がインフレの一因であることを裏付けるデータはないということですね。


ジェローム・パウエル
インフレと収益との関連性を追跡するのは非常に困難です。


ダニエル・ミーサー
イエレン長官は、食料品に価格ショックがあるとは感じていないと述べました。食料品とガソリンは、アメリカの家庭と私の有権者にとって2つの大きな問題ですが、あなたの政策がこの2つの問題の緩和に役立っていると思いますか？


ジェローム・パウエル
まずエネルギーを取り上げましょう。エネルギー価格は一般的に世界レベルで決定されます。私たちはそれに何らかの影響を及ぼしています。


DANIEL MEUSER：
すみません、会長。時間がなくなってしまいました。ありがとうございます。失礼します。


ジェローム・パウエル：
続けましょう


DANIEL MEUSER：
ありがとう ありがとう


パトリック・メンリー
ミズーリ州選出のクリーバー氏に5分間の発言を認めます。


エマニュエル・クリーバー
ありがとうございます、議長。議長、お集まりいただきありがとうございます。そして、ある意味では、私はフォローアップしたいというか、少なくとも非常に礼儀正しい対応をしていきたいと思います。しかし、なぜ独立した中央銀行が必要なのか、その理由とあなたの回答は、あなたが提起した質問に私が答えると、長い、ある種の政治的な道筋になってしまうというものでした。

あなたはその道を走りたくなかった。ですから、私は・・・私もこの委員会にしばらくいましたから、よく出てくる議論にとても関心があります。連邦準備制度が誕生したのは世紀の変わり目で、確か1913年か1918年か、そんな頃だったと思います。

中央銀行が設立される前は、我が国は多くの不況に見舞われていました。誰もコントロールできなかったから、特に経済界は大きな投資をすることに不安を感じていた。ただ、何が起こったかというと、ただ起こったというだけなんです。


ジェローム・パウエル：
1836年からFRBが設立されるまでの間、中央銀行が存在しなかったため、多くの不況が発生しました。その多くは農作物のサイクルと関係があり、銀行は季節的な大きな変動に対応できず、流動性を供給する中央銀行もありませんでした。それが、前世紀初頭にFRBが設立された理由です。


エマニュエル・クリーバー
金融政策と財政政策を融合させるのは危険だと思いますか？


ジェローム・パウエル
融合させる？


そうです：
そうだ


そうです：
 私たちには、皆さんから与えられた、本当に具体的で狭い、しかし重要な使命があり、それに忠実であろうとしています。

そして、皆さんの政策を与えられたものとして受け止め、それに基づいて金融政策を行うのです。


エマニュエル・クリーバー
このプロジェクト2025の文書をすべて読んだわけではありません。しかし、2025年であろうと30年であろうと89年であろうと、何であろうと、私が懸念していることの一つは、この文書を読んで、連邦準備制度理事会（FRB）こそがインフレの問題であり、FRB内部からではなく、FRBに経済政策を押し付ける連邦準備制度理事会（FRB）を排除することだと主張していることです。それで、私は......あなたはそのどれかに賛成ですか？

私やマクヘンリー議長、あるいは他の誰かから出たものなのかどうか？


ジェローム・パウエル
だから、まず最初に言っておきますが、私たちは人々がどんな批判をしようとも公平に受け止めています。私たちが学んだこと、私たちが知っていることは、独立した中央銀行を持つことは、高くて不安定なインフレを望むのであれば、本当に必要不可欠なことだということです。

ですから、私は率直に言って、このような考え方は、ここ国会議事堂では両政党とも非常に広く受け入れられていると思います。


エマニュエル・クリーバー
連邦準備制度理事会（FRB）を廃止することが、経済の安定を促進するために最善だということですか？


ジェローム・パウエル：
そうです


そうです
ありがとうございます 議長が住宅問題を 扱うと知っていました 彼女はいつもそうする。彼女が住宅問題に執着していることには感謝しているし、私はその執着心が好きだ。しかし、私は......私たちがこの......この問題にどう対処すべきかを考えようとしているときに......ああ、大変だ、時間がなくなってしまった。


ジェローム・パウエル
質問ですか？


エマニュエル・クリーバー
そうだ、もし君が... はい、もしあなたが......もし私がどこに行こうとしているかご存じでしたら、お願いします。


パトリック・メンリー
時間切れです。ニューヨーク選出のガーバリーノ氏に5分間の持ち時間を認めます。


アンドリュー・ガルバリーノ
議長、ありがとうございます。パウエル議長、本日はありがとうございます。今日と昨日のコメントによると、バーゼルIII最終案の変更についてかなり進展があったようですね。バーゼルIII最終案の変更点については、かなり進展があったようですね。

具体的な内容には触れないということですね。あなたはそう言っている。ただ、どこまで踏み込まないのかはわかりません。ただ、あなたが同僚のミュザー氏に言ったことを確認したいだけです。いくつかのことを再提案するわけではありません。部分的な再提案となるだけだ


ジェローム・パウエル
私たちが検討しているのは、これまで取り組んできた主要なことです。そして、再提案されない追加変更もあるだろう。それが私たちが取り組んでいることであり、全面的な広範な提案ではありません。


アンドリュー・ガルバリーノ
では、完全な再提案ではなく、部分的なものなのですね？


ジェローム・パウエル：
そうだ 少なくとも......どのような構成要素なのか教えてもらえますか......まだ......すべてが合意され、準備が整い、吟味されるまでは......あまり具体的なことは言いたくないのですが......ただ......このようなことをするときには、すべてが合意されるまでは何も合意されないものです。


アンドリュー・ガルバリーノ
いえ、わかっています。ただ...


ジェローム・パウエル：
そうだ


そうだ
具体的な変更点を聞いてるのでは...


ジェローム・パウエル：
そうだ


そうだ
どのような...どのような...どのような...どのような...どのような...


ジェローム・パウエル：
私たちは......私はあなたに来ることができることを願っています......


...あなたのところに..：
そうですか


そのことについては..：
私たちは......私たちは準備ができていると思います......私たちは準備ができていると思います...... つまり、私たちは......私たちは準備ができていると思います......。


アンドリュー・ガルバリーノ：
わかった


ジェローム・パウエル：
FRBの準備はできています。


それは..：
次の質問です。何度か言われていることですが、あなたや多くの理事会メンバーは、FDICやOCCのカウンターパートと、コメント募集のための修正案の提出の進め方をめぐって対立しています。では、FDICとOCCが新たなコメント期間を設けることにまだ同意していないのであれば、誰がこのコンセンサスを妨げているのでしょうか？

グルーエンバーグ委員長か？チョプラ理事ですか？


ジェローム・パウエル
対立しているとは言いたくない。ただ、私たちは......私たちは一緒にこの問題に取り組んでいます。そして...


アンドリュー・ガルバリーノ
"誰か "が支えている


ジェローム・パウエル
建設的な議論だと思う。建設的なものだと思うし、これからもそうしていこうと思う。


アンドリュー・ガルバリーノ
少なくとも、FDICの5人の理事が署名する必要があるのか、それとも......それとも......委員長にだけでも答えてもらえますか？


ジェローム・パウエル
いいえ、理事会だと思います。もちろん、会計監査人も1人です。しかし、FDICは自らの意見を述べることができる。しかし、私はFDICの理事会が問題だと思います。


アンドリュー・ガルバリーノ
わかりました。次に進む前に、最後の質問です。昨日、合理的な予測として、バーゼルが最終化されるのは2025年の第1四半期になるだろうとおっしゃっていました。このスケジュールでは、少なくとも2026年初めまでは実施されないということでよろしいでしょうか？


ジェローム・パウエル
具体的には申し上げられません。そして、それは......誰かが私に......来年の第1四半期になるかもしれないように聞こえるかと尋ねたので、そうかもしれないと答えた。つまり、かかる時間には幅があるということだ。つまり、かかる時間には幅があるということです。先ほど申し上げたように、米国の銀行はこの規則と何年も付き合っていくことになります。

重要なのは、このルールを正しく理解することであって、すぐに実行することではない。我々は...


アンドリュー・ガルバリーノ
わかったよ


ジェローム・パウエル：
その結果、持続可能なルールが確立され、また戻って間違いを修正する必要がなくなる。


アンドリュー・ガルバリーノ
ありがとうございます。別の話題、長期債務に移りたいと思います。昨日、あなたは、バーゼル改正案が理解され、受け入れられるようになるまで、他のルールは進めないとおっしゃいました。銀行が長期債務に関して何らかの行動を起こす前に、バーゼル案の意味を十分に理解する必要があるからです。

最後に、パウエル議長、FRBが現在の流動性の枠組みについて、包括的でデータに基づいた、そして最も重要なことですが、透明性のある評価を行う必要性を強調したいと思います。そこで早速ですが、新たな流動性規制を課す前に、公的な定量的影響調査を実施し、完全な通知とコメントによるルール作りを行うことを約束していただけますか？


ジェローム・パウエル
その最初の部分は聞き取れませんでした。


アンドリュー・ガルバリーノ
新たな流動性規制を課す前に、公的な定量的影響調査を実施し、完全な通知とコメントによるルールメイキングを行うことを約束しますか？


ジェローム・パウエル
流動性については、何を考えているのかよくわかりません。というのも、これらは斬新なアイデアであり、私たちもそれを理解しているからです。


アンドリュー・ガルバリーノ
わかりました。先ほど委員長がおっしゃったように、これらの影響調査は非常に重要です。というのも、バーゼル2.0ではプロセスがめちゃくちゃになってしまった。

あと少し時間があります。ペンシルベニア州選出の同僚、ミーサー氏にお譲りします。


DANIEL MEUSER：
ありがとうございます。パウエル議長、今お話しした食料品やガソリンの価格の不安定さについてですが、私たちはアフォーダビリティ・クライシス（値ごろ感の危機）と呼ばれているような状況にあります。近い将来、金利を引き下げることは、成長促進につながるのでしょうか？実際に投資を促進し、投資に明確な見通しを与え、おそらくこれら2つのカテゴリーで助けとなり、最終的には供給を増加させることで、これらの価格を引き下げるようなことが検討されているのでしょうか？


ジェローム・パウエル
正直なところ、短期的な金利の動きについて考えるとき、私たちはいくつかのことを考えています。


DANIEL MEUSER：
申し訳ありません、議長。申し訳ありません、議長。


ジェローム・パウエル：
申し訳ありません。


申し訳ありません
議長、降参します 同僚に譲ります。


パトリック・メンリー
カリフォルニアのバルガスさん、5分間です。


バルガスです：
議長、本公聴会に改めて感謝いたします。パウエル議長、ありがとうございます。パウエル議長、お集まりいただきありがとうございます。感謝いたします。実は、誰があなたを指名したのか、いつここに来たのかなど、あなたの経歴を見ていました。実は、それ以前にも公職に就いていたのですね？


ジェローム・パウエル：
そうです


そうです：
ですから、国家への長いご公務に感謝します。私は...


ジェローム・パウエル：
ありがとう


ありがとう
あなたは傑出していた 私たちは...


ジェローム・パウエル：
感謝する


JUAN VARGAS：
深く尊敬する はっきり言って退屈だ


ジェローム・パウエル：
どうした？


フアン・バルガス：
はっきり言って退屈だ


ジェローム・パウエル：
ありがとう お褒めの言葉です。


JUAN VARGAS：
そうなんです。ここにいると、いろいろな種類のカメラがあって、あなたの一挙手一投足を監視されていることがありますから。それには理由がある。それは経済がうまくいっているからだ。それは間違っていますか？


ジェローム・パウエル
私たちの経済を見てください。成長率は2％前後だ。インフレ率は2．失業率は4.1％だ。これはいい数字だ。


JUAN VARGAS：
しかし、それを証明するメディアはここにはない。実際、正反対だ。イギリスの新政権の見出しを読んだことがあるだろうか？いくつかの見出しは......見出しは......ひとつ読ませてください。英国の新政権は第二次世界大戦以来最悪の経済的苦境を引き継ぐと書かれている。実際、そのような見出しがいくつもあり、イギリスは大変なことになっていると言っている。

もしあなたがイギリスの中央銀行を経営していたら、いったい何をしているのか、何をしていないのかを調べるために、多くのメディアがあなたを叩きのめすに違いない。その理由は、繰り返しになるが、この国の政府がかなり良い仕事をしているからだと思う。あなたが予想していなかったことのひとつに、パンデミックがあると言いましたね？

私はあなたの口に言葉を入れるつもりはない。


ジェローム・パウエル：
そうだ


そうだ
実際、私はここにいて 不景気や恐慌になるという 恐ろしい話のオンパレードを聞きました 実際、国は崩壊しそうだ そうなのか？


ジェローム・パウエル：
他の国々がそうであったように、私たちも高インフレの時期を経験しました。


ジュアン・バルガス
実際、そうした国々のほとんどは、私たちヨーロッパよりもインフレ率が高かったのではないですか？


ジェローム・パウエル：
長期的には、インフレ率が高い時期もありました。


JUAN VARGAS：
ええ、そうでした。


そうです：
全体的には、ほぼ同等だったと思います。


ええ：
私たちよりもインフレ率が高い国がたくさんありましたから。


ジェローム・パウエル：
ウクライナ戦争から派生したエネルギー問題で、ヨーロッパは私たちよりもずっと大きな打撃を受けました。


確かに：
もちろん、不安定な問題は他にもたくさんある。ウクライナには政情不安やその他多くの問題がありました。しかし、今日興味深いのは、私たちが耳にしているような悲惨な出来事のオンパレードが、メディアや普段のような注目を浴びることによって顕在化していないように見えるということです。

それはいいことだ。素晴らしいことだと思います。さて、いくつか質問をさせてください。住宅に関するバーゼルIIIには懸念があります。そのような懸念は、あなたのオフィスにも伝えたと思いますし、蒸し返すつもりはありません。しかし、気候に関してお話ししたいことがあります。ニュースをあまり読まないとおっしゃいましたね。

プロジェクト'25のこともご存じない。そういう意味でおっしゃったのではないと思いますし、あなたの口をふさぐつもりはありません。私は、あの......ランキングメンバーから聞いたとき、あなたは「聞いていない」と答えたと思います。おそらく聞いたことはあると思うが、読んでいないと思う。


ジェローム・パウエル
見出ししか見たことがない。つまり、私は...


JUAN VARGAS：
そうだ 私もだ。私は...


JEROME POWELL：
エネルギーは...


JUAN VARGAS：
でも、見出しは読みます。しかし、私が見出しについて尋ねる理由は、あなたは明らかにテキサスで起こったことを見ているからです。あなたは......気候変動で何が起こったかを見てきた。実際、あなたは以前、気候変動を信じていると証言したと思います。

それは正しいですか？


ジェローム・パウエル
そうです


JUAN VARGAS：
そうだ それで、私たちは何をしているのですか？あなたは、気候変動のリスクに目を向けるために、非常に前向きなステップをいくつも踏んできたと思います。そのいくつかを紹介していただけますか？私はそれが心配なのです。この変化は、私たちが予想していなかった変化だと思います。

私はずっとそう言い続けてきた。しかし、多くの人々は信じなかった。


ジェローム・パウエル
ですから、金融規制当局を見るということは、気候変動に対して非常に限られた役割しか担っていない人たちを見るということです。私たちが監督している金融機関を見て、彼らがそのリスクを理解し、管理できることを確認するだけです。私たちは気候政策の立案者ではありません。

それは...


JUAN VARGAS：
そうですね。私はそんなことは聞いていない。


ジェローム・パウエル：
選挙で選ばれた人でなければならない


JUAN VARGAS：
そうだ しかし、リスクを考慮する必要がある。つまり、保険会社が負っているリスクを見てください。もちろん、銀行はこれらの住宅に融資しています。それが保険に加入できなくなり、突然再建が不可能になる。つまり、銀行が抱えているリスクなのです。


ジェローム・パウエル
保険会社を規制することはありません。


JUAN VARGAS：
そうです。しかし、銀行を規制している


ジェローム・パウエル：
銀行ですね


そうだ
銀行が保険で抵当権を設定している家もありますよね？


ジェローム・パウエル：
多くの場合、彼らはもう住宅ローンを書いていません。つまり、銀行がこのようなリスクを認識しているということです。そうです。


JUAN VARGAS：
ありがとうございました。時間切れです。でも、ありがとうございました。ありがとう


ジェローム・パウエル：
ありがとう


パトリック・メンリー：
カリフォルニアからお越しの キムさん 5分間です


ヤング・キム：
ありがとうございます。パウエル議長、本日はありがとうございます。パウエル議長、本日はありがとうございます。私は、あなたがリーダーシップを発揮し、物価の安定と最大限の雇用というFRBの中核的使命に集中していることを称賛します。

あなたのリーダーシップに改めて感謝します。また、バーゼルIIIの最終的な見直し案を再度公表し、意見を求める必要があるというのがFRBの強い見解であると述べられました。私は、FDICとOCCが意見募集を再開するよう強く求めます。パウエル委員長：広範な支持というのは、修正案のパブリック・コメント期間において、ほとんどが否定的なパブリック・コメントを集めた修正案の放棄を意味するのでしょうか。


ジェローム・パウエル
すみません。あなたの質問についていけませんでした。


ヤング・キム
広範な支持とは、修正案に対するパブリックコメント期間中に、ほとんどが否定的なパブリックコメントを集めた修正案の放棄を意味するのでしょうか？


ジェローム・パウエル：
広範な支持とは......経験的には、FRB理事会でしっかりとした投票が行われることを意味します。それが何を意味するのか、私は具体的に述べないようにしてきた。しかし、それはつまり、あらゆる立場のコメンテーターたちの幅広い支持を意味する。幅広い支持というのは、そういう意味です。


ヤング・キム：
そうだ。


ジェローム・パウエル：
ええ、そういう意味です。


ヤング・キム：
ありがとう。また、FRBがバーゼル案のいくつかの変更を実施することを検討している中で、私は、バーゼル最終 -- 終局案が、外部オペレーショナル・リスクの加重のされ方のために、FBOや地方銀行、米国内 の雇用に不釣り合いな影響を与えることを見過ごさないよう強く求めたいと思います。その点についてのあなたのコミットメントをお聞かせください。


ジェローム・パウエル
具体的なことは申し上げません。そうした懸念は十分に承知している。私たちは......私たちは......私たちは明らかに、すべての異なるセクターから得たすべてのコメントを慎重に消化しました。


ヤング・キム：
ありがとうございます。話を別の問題に移しましょう。あなたは透明性の必要性を訴えました。FRBでは、ストレス・テストにもっと透明性を持たせ、より良い関与と一貫性を持たせるための話し合いは行われているのでしょうか？


ジェローム・パウエル
ストレステストの透明性は時間をかけて高めてきました。もし人々がストレステストに批判的な記事を書いたり、コメントを出したりしたければ、私たちはそれを読み、それについて考えるつもりです。私たちは、それを改善することに前向きだ。ストレステストが適切なものであり続けるためには、時間をかけて進化していかなければならないことは承知しています。

透明性というのは、私たちが耳を傾け、アイデアを考える用意があるテーマのひとつだと思います。


ヤング・キム：
そうですね。私は、より透明性が高く、より適応したストレステスト制度を見てみたいと思っています。バーゼルIIIの枠組みや既存の金融危機後の流動性規制と、新しい流動性基準の累積的な影響について、あなたや同僚の銀行規制当局が検討しているかどうかも聞きたいと思います。

また、流動性規制の枠組みの変更に関して、理事会スタッフはどのような業界との意見交換を行いましたか。


ジェローム・パウエル
流動性の枠組みに関する提案はまだ行っていません。しかし、この提案について、業界との意見交換はかなり行われています。そして、私たちは・・・・・・今年のある時期に、流動性の枠組みの変更に向けて動き出すと思います。


ヤング・キム
理事会のスタッフについてはどうですか？既存の流動性の枠組みを変更する必要性やその影響を調査するために、業界全体のデータ収集を行ったのでしょうか？




ジェローム・パウエル
その点については、多くの調査を行ったと思います。しかし、これはプロセスの始まりであって、終わりではありません。まだ提案は公表していない。かなり初期の段階です。


ヤング・キム：
ありがとうございます。早速ですが、インフレ問題についてお話します。インフレ率のピークは2022年6月の9.1％でした。これは供給サイドの問題であり、開国経済による需要ショックであると言われています。では、マネーサプライの拡大と財政刺激策がインフレの持続にどのような役割を果たしたのか、詳しく教えてください。

また、なぜ今インフレ率2％の目標を達成することが重要なのでしょうか？


ジェローム・パウエル
ここで起きたインフレは、経済の再開に伴う非常に強い需要との衝突でした。財政移転があったことを覚えておいてください。金利は非常に低かった。私たちは、経済が非常に悪化する可能性があると考えたからです。結果的に経済は再開し、需要が急増した。

人々はお金を使うことができなかったので、たくさんのお金を貯めていた。つまり、膨大な需要があり、供給が制限されていたのだ。その結果、世界中どこでもインフレが起こった。それが起きたのです。インフレを引き下げるために何が起こったかというと、私たちはインフレに関してかなりの進歩を遂げたのです。

インフレを下げるために、FRBは制限的な政策で需要を冷やすことに取り組んできた。それが功を奏している。供給サイドも回復している。そして、労働参加率のマイナス・ショックは、インフレ調整によって実質的に逆転しました。


パトリック・メンリー

ジェローム・パウエル：
というわけで、私たちが予想していたとおりになっています。

パトリック・メンリー
ジョージア州からお越しのウィリアムズさん、5分間です。


ニケマ・ウィリアムズ
マクヘンリー議長、ありがとうございます。パウエル議長、本日はありがとうございます。アトランタ連邦準備銀行の総裁であるラファエル・ボスティック氏は、経済的不平等と闘うことがFRBの二重の使命の重要な部分であることを正しく指摘しています。地域社会の誰もが潜在能力を最大限に発揮して貢献する機会を得られない場合、経済はすべてのシリンダーをフル回転させることはできません。

私の地元アトランタ市は、全米で最も黒人経営の企業が多い都市でありながら、人種間の貧富の格差では依然として全米トップクラスにある。私は、連邦準備制度理事会（FRB）のあなたとあなたのスタッフが、ジョージア州第5選挙区で戦う勤勉な人々にとっても、上位1％の人々にとっても、経済が同じようにうまく機能するようにするために行っている仕事に拍手を送ります。

これには、金融サービスが誰にとっても手頃な価格で利用できるようにするための支援も含まれます。FRBがレギュレーションⅡの変更案を進める中、手頃な価格で利用しやすい銀行へのアクセスを保護することが、皆さんの最優先事項であることは承知しています。だからこそ、アトランタの私の有権者を含む、社会から疎外されたコミュニティに対して、規制Ⅱの規則案が意図せざる影響を与えるのではないかという働きかけを受け始めたとき、私は懸念を抱いたのです。

具体的には、この規則で提案されているインターチェンジ・フィーの引き下げが、私の選挙区や全国の銀行所有の認証口座に与える影響について聞きました。銀行が所有するイニシアチブは、金融機関と信頼できるコミュニティベースの組織とのパートナーシップであり、銀行口座を持たない人々や銀行口座を持たない人々に低コストまたは無料の銀行口座を提供するものです。

アクセスとアフォーダビリティは、あなたが提案している改革の核心であり、私はこの目標にこれ以上賛成することはできません。しかし、私たちは、社会から疎外されたコミュニティにおいて、銀行口座を持たない人々や銀行口座を持たない人々にサービスを提供するために考案されたプログラムが、今後も繁栄し続けるようにしなければなりません。このような懸念に応えるため、私と同僚であるルエトケマイヤー氏は3月に超党派の意見書を送り、まさにこのような懸念を強調し、最終規則が低所得者や中所得者のコミュニティに悪影響を与えないよう強く求めました。

パウエル議長、FRBは規制が弁護士や利益団体を持たない有権者にどのような影響を与えるか、どのように考慮していますか？


ジェローム・パウエル
まず最初に申し上げておきたいのは、私たちは、パウエルさんや他の方々が提起された規則案の懸念について耳にしているということです。そして、私たちはその懸念を非常によく理解しています。コメントレターがない場合、私たちは......つまり、私たちは規制の影響について思慮深くありたいと思っています。

しかし、基本的にはパブリックコメントを求めています。


ニケマ・ウィリアムズ
ありがとうございます。FDICの最新のデータによると、銀行口座を持たない世帯の割合は過去最低となっています。銀行所有のイニシアチブは、この進歩に重要な役割を果たしています。銀行が所有する認証口座は、50州全土の低・中所得世帯の95％以上が利用可能です。

低コストまたは無料の銀行サービスへのアクセスは、社会から疎外された家庭にとって、金融包摂と富の創出への扉である。Reg IIのままでは、過去数年間に達成された大きな進歩のいくつかが台無しになりかねない。パウエル委員長、今後の規則案が連邦準備制度理事会（FRB）の金融包摂の取り組みを強化するツールへの米国人のアクセスを妨げないようにするために、規制当局は本委員会のメンバーとどのように協力できるでしょうか。


ジェローム・パウエル
私たちは、ご指摘のように、銀行が所有しているようなものや、社会から疎外されたコミュニティが金融システムにアクセスすることに非常に重点を置いています。私たちは、そのようなことに重きを置くようなことはしたくありません。そのような問題について、あなたやあなたのオフィスと協力できることをうれしく思います。

しかし、私たちは......先ほど申し上げたように、私たちは......私たちはコメントを聞いていますし、読んでいます。そして、私たちは......私たちは、提案の適切な変更を考えるために、それらを考慮しています。


ニケマ・ウィリアムズ
というのも、私たちがこの規制を策定する際には、現実世界への影響や、消費者が金融機関にアクセスする際の意味について考えていることを確認したいからです。私は、FRBの金融包摂の取り組みを促進するために、皆さんと協力することを楽しみにしています。

今週初めには、連邦準備制度理事会（FRB）が4月に提案した、Fedwire資金サービスの営業時間を1日22時間、週7日、年中無休とする提案に関連した超党派の書簡をお送りしました。これは私がぜひ聞きたかったニュースだった。これは技術的には小さな変更に聞こえるかもしれないが、私たちの有権者、特に給料をもらいながら生活している社会から疎外された地域に住む人々にとっては大きな影響を与える可能性がある。

アラバマ州スミス・ステーションという活況を呈する大都市で育ったパウエル委員長は、おそらく聞いたことがないだろうが、ローンや短期ローンの選択肢は限られている。誰もが通勤に車を必要とし、食べるために働かなければならないこの地域では、お金が不足しているとき、給与へのアクセスや請求書の支払いが遅れると、家庭全体が混乱してしまいます。

Fedwire Funds ServiceとNational Settlement Serviceの営業時間を延長することで、通常の営業時間外でも資金にアクセスできるようになります。小槌の音が聞こえる。時間切れとなりましたが、引き続きお話を伺います。ありがとう


ジェローム・パウエル
ありがとう


パトリック・メンリー
ネブラスカ州からお越しの フラッドさん 5分間です


マイク・フラッド：
ありがとうございます、議長。パウエル議長：この1年、非常に高いインフレが続き、アメリカ人の給与を直撃しましたが、インフレ率はいくぶん緩やかになりました。しかし、インフレ率は連邦準備制度理事会（FRB）が設定した目標インフレ率2％を依然として上回っています。実際、PCEインフレ指数は過去3年間2％を上回ったままである。

年初に発表された連邦公開市場委員会（FOMC）の「長期目標と金融政策戦略に関する声明」では、"委員会は、長期的に平均2％のインフレを達成することを目指しており、したがって、インフレ率が2％を下回って推移している期間の後、適切な金融政策は、しばらくの間、2％を緩やかに上回るインフレを達成することを目指す可能性が高いと判断する "と述べられている。パウエル議長、長期的に平均2％を達成するというコミットメントは、反対方向にも適用されるのでしょうか？

つまり、インフレ率が2％を上回る状態が長期にわたった場合、委員会は代わりに、平均インフレ率2％を達成するために、しばらくの間、2％を適度に下回るインフレ率を目指すのでしょうか？


ジェローム・パウエル
そうではありません。


マイク・フロッド
利下げを検討するためには、PCE指数が今後数カ月の間に少なくとも一度は2％を下回る必要があるということでしょうか？


ジェローム・パウエル
いや、それはフェアではない。インフレには一定の勢いがあるからだ。インフレには勢いがありますから。なぜなら、インフレ率には一定の勢いがあるからです。


MIKE FLOOD：
今月あるいは9月の利下げを支持するためには、どのような要因が重なればよいでしょうか？


ジェローム・パウエル
だから、私は......もう一度言うが、私は......私は政策について、いかなる会合のいかなる特定の日についてもシグナルを発していない。昨日もそう言ったし、今日もそう言っている。しかし、あなたの質問には答えよう。私たちが申し上げたのは、より自信を持ちたいということです。つまり、インフレ率が持続的に2％まで低下していることを示す良いインフレ指標が増えれば、それが事実であるという確信が深まるということです。

しかし、私たちには二重の使命もあることを忘れないでください。私たちはインフレ目標を掲げるだけの中央銀行ではありません。雇用の義務もある。ですから、労働市場に予想外の弱さが見られた場合、私たちは利下げを行う可能性もあります。そして今、私たちはこう考えています。

私は今、この2つの義務に対するリスクはバランスが取れていると考えています。長い間、私たちはインフレ率に重点を置いてきた。しかし今、私たちは、労働市場が必要なバランスにかなり近づいていると思います。ですから、私たちはその両側面を見ているのです。


マイク・フロード
メディアなどが連邦準備制度理事会に対する政治的干渉の見通しについて話し続けていることは知っています。選挙を控え、7月と9月に開かれる公開市場委員会に対する監視の目が厳しくなっていることは承知しています。この機会に、選挙に向けた連邦準備制度理事会（FRB）の政治的独立性についてお話いただけますか。


ジェローム・パウエル
もちろん、喜んで。私たちの政治的な独立性は、私たちが仕事をし、政治的なスペクトルを超えて人々の信頼を維持するために非常に重要です。私たちは経済データ、進展する見通し、リスクのバランスに基づいて決断を下すのであって、政治的要因を含む他のいかなる要因も考慮することはありません。

私たちには、そうしてきた長い歴史がありますし、国民も私たちがそうすると信じていると思います。私たちが金利や政策手段に関して下す決断はすべて、データに十分に裏打ちされたものであり、近い将来および中期的に米国民にとって何が最善であるかについての私たちの最善の考えを示すものです。

そしてそれが、私が、そして私の同僚全員が約束することです。そしてそれは、選挙サイクルなどには目を向けないということです。私たちは......そのようなものを見ているのではありません。私たちが見ているのはデータであり、そのデータから何が正しいことなのか、ということです。それがわかったら、動くべき時が来たと判断し、動き出す。


MIKE FLOOD：
ありがとうございます。最後に、住居費について懸念を示したいと思います。住まいはPCE計算の広範な構成要素のひとつですが、多くの消費者にとって、住まいはしばしば、最大とは言わないまでも、最大の出費のひとつを占めています。住宅のインフレ率は依然として高い。この経済の特徴のひとつは、消費者の消費マインドが著しく低いことです。

住宅費の高騰が消費者心理の低迷の一因になっているとお考えですか？


ジェローム・パウエル
一般的に物価が高いと思います。この件に関しては、誰も超高確率で答えられないと思います。しかし、インフレ率が下がっている一方で、物価が高いという事実があると思います。

私にとっては、これが調査を説明する方法です。私たちは、経済が成長し、インフレ率が下がり、失業率が低いと言います。しかし、物価は高い。


マイク・フロッド
パウエル議長、ご回答と証言に感謝します。お先に失礼します。


パトリック・メンリー
ニューヨークのトーレスさん、5分間です。


リッチー・トーレス
ありがとうございます。パウエル議長、FRBはインフレ率の目標を2％としています。PCEインフレ率とCPIインフレ率の両方が2％に低下するのを待っているのですか、それともどちらか一方だけを待っているのですか？


ジェローム・パウエル
私たちはさまざまな指標を見ています。しかし、四半世紀にわたってPCEインフレ率がFRBの目標でした。PCEインフレは、国民が実際に直面するコストやインフレを測るのに最も適した指標だと考えているからです。


リッチー・トーレス
そして今、あなたは2％の目標に到達する前に金利を引き下げてもいいとおっしゃいました。利下げを決断するのは、2％への道筋で特定の目標を達成するためなのでしょうか、それともインフレ率の全体的な軌跡に左右されるのでしょうか？


ジェローム・パウエル
データを総合的に判断することになる。私たちが念頭に置いている特定の数字があるわけではありません。私たちが自問自答しているのは、インフレ率が本当に2％に向かって下がっているという確信が十分にあるかどうかということです。

つまり、ボラティリティを通して見るインフレ率はどの程度なのか、ということです。また、労働市場にも注目しています。最大限の雇用を考慮に入れなければなりません。ですから、私たちはその両方を見て判断しているのです。


リッチー・トーレス
つまり、インフレ率が下降基調にあると確信していますか？


ジェローム・パウエル：
そう確信しています。過去数年間、私たちはそれを見てきたと思います。問題は、インフレ率が持続的に2％まで低下しているという確信が十分にあるかどうかということです。


リッチー・トーレス
パウエル議長は、バーゼルIIIを単なる改定ではなく、再提案すると発表しました。バーゼルIIIがない場合、米国の銀行システムは十分な資本増強がなされているとお考えですか？


ジェローム・パウエル
私は長い間、米国の銀行は十分に資本を増強しており、米国の銀行システムの資本水準はほぼ適正だと考えてきました。


リッチー・トーレス
では、バーゼルIIIがなくても銀行システムの資本が十分に充実しているのであれば、バーゼルIIIの必要性はいったいどこにあるのでしょうか？


ジェローム・パウエル
まず第一に、適切な資本水準について正確な答えはありません。私たちはバーゼル基準の策定に参加してきました。バーゼル基準は国際的な広範な平仄を合わせるものです。それが重要なのです。他の大規模な国・地域が行っていることと同等のことを行い、バーゼルと整合性を保つことが重要です。

それが銀行が望んでいることであり、私たちが望んでいることであり、国民に最も貢献できることだと思います。


リッチー・トーレス
しかし、あなたは金メッキを施さずに適合させるべきだという意見に同意していますね。


ジェローム・パウエル
金メッキを施したものもあれば、そうでないものもある。しかし、私は、最終的にはバーゼルの要件と整合的であるべきだと思いますし、他の大規模な法域が行っていることと整合的であるべきだと思います。


リッチー・トーレス
バーゼルIIIが推奨する標準化と、議会が義務付けた規制の個別化との間に法的な抵触はないと確信していますか？


ジェローム・パウエル
バーゼルIIIが推奨する標準化と、議会が義務づける規制の調整との間に、法的な抵触はないとお考えですか？


リッチー・トーレス
しかし、もし...


バーゼルは..：
-- バーゼルは誰に対しても要件を課しているわけではありませんし、強制力のある要件もありません。バーゼルには強制力はない。バーゼルが何をしようとしているのか。バーゼルは誰も縛らない。


リッチー・トーレス
しかし、あなたが採用しようとしている規制の枠組みは、その勧告を成文化したものであり、法律の効力を持つことになりますね？


ジェローム・パウエル：
その通りです


リッチー・トーレス
もし成文化された勧告と議会法の間に矛盾があった場合、議会法が勧告に優先することに同意しますか？


ジェローム・パウエル：
はい、もちろんです


リッチー・トーレス
バーゼルIIIについて、シェブロンの遡及効がなくなることは何か影響があるのでしょうか？


ジェローム・パウエル：
行政法に関するいくつかの判決がありますが、それを評価するのはまだ時期尚早です。つまり、最終的には、私たちが取っている行動が法律を遵守しているかどうかということであり、その決定は、行政機関の意見に対してあまり尊重されないか、あるいは全く尊重されないかもしれないと言っている。

しかし、それは裁判所が同じ質問に答えることを意味します。


リッチー・トーレス
FRBにはインフレ率の目標があります。FRBは量的引き締めに関して、例えばFRBのバランスシートをどの程度にすべきかといった目標を持っているのでしょうか？


ジェローム・パウエル
具体的な目標はありません。


リッチー・トーレス
FRBにとって健全な規模とはどの程度だとお考えですか？


ジェローム・パウエル：
私たちはそれを、数字ではなく言葉で定義しています。私たちは、バッファーを備えた潤沢な準備体制を望んでいるのです。そして、それを経験的に見つけるのです。


リッチー・トーレス
それを数字で示すことはできますか？


ジェローム・パウエル：
いいえ、それはできません


リッチー・トーレス：
何十年もの間、私たちは低失業率と低インフレという、両世界の最高のものを手にしてきました。アメリカ経済は低失業率と低インフレの黄金時代に戻ることができるのでしょうか、それとも金利上昇という新たな常態を生きる運命にあるのでしょうか？


ジェローム・パウエル
低インフレ、低失業率、低インフレ、低失業率、低失業率、低失業率、低失業率、低失業率、低失業率。


リッチー・トーレス
高インフレだ。私たちは両方の世界のベストを手に入れることができますか？


ジェローム・パウエル
それが計画です。インフレ率を2％に戻すつもりだ。私はそう確信している。私たちは......インフレ率の上昇ショックが多い世界に入りつつあり、それは困難な世界だろうという意見もある。しかし、それはまだわかりません。


リッチー・トーレス
ありがとうございます。


パトリック・メンリー
アイオワ州からお越しのナンさん、5分間です。


ザック・ナン
ありがとうございます 議長


ジェローム・パウエル：
パウエル議長、本日はありがとうございます。パウエル議長、本日はありがとうございます。アイオワ州出身の優秀なスタッフがいて、列車を時間通りに走らせることができる。素晴らしいことだ。

アイオワ州の平均的な家庭は、ここ3年間で、毎月約925ドルのインフレに見舞われています。卵の生産量が全米一のアイオワ州には6人の子供がいますが、子供たち一人ひとりの卵の値段はこの1年で40％も上がり、6人分の卵を買うことになります。

私は経済学者ではありませんが、これは本当にすぐに加算され、私は今、全国の多くの家族を反映していると思います。


ザック・ナン：
そこで議長、私がお話ししたいことの一つは、私たちが力を入れていることと、FRBであなたの部署が取り組んでいることです。私の意見では、米国連邦準備制度理事会（FRB）は、例えばベルギーのブリュッセルにいる選挙で選ばれたわけでもない官僚たちから出てくる情報よりも、私の故郷であるアイオワ州ボンデュラントのような人々にもっと焦点を当てるべきだと思います。

私はあなたとあなたのチームに拍手を送りたい。私は、バーゼルIIIの全面的な廃止を望んでいる。この提案の中で、早急に検討しなければならないことが3つあると思います。ひとつは、信用供与の可能性、特にアイオワ州のような故郷の中小企業の信用状況が厳しくならないようにすること、全国の農家がバーゼルIIIの新しい話の中で穀物やトウモロコシ、大豆の家畜をヘッジできるようにすること。

そして最終的には、アメリカの銀行がバーゼルIIIやヨーロッパでより高い基準で管理されるようになることで、川下への影響を排除することができるのです。そこで、私がジェリー・モラン上院議員とともに超党派の方法で送付した書簡について、貴チームの注意を喚起し、特に銀行資本規制の強化が経済、有権者、ひいては全国の農業生産者に及ぼす悪影響を強調したいと思います。

そこでまず申し上げたいのは、概要が示された次のバーゼルIII案が、農家を含む農業生産者の懸念に対処するものであることを確認できますか？


ジェローム・パウエル
ヘッジに関するご懸念は十分承知しておりますし、あまり具体的に申し上げるつもりはありませんが、そのようなご懸念はかなり承知しております。


ザック・ナン
私は自分の選挙区に帰ってきて、最も耳の痛い話の1つだからだ。もし、議会や私の選挙区の農家が最初の話し合いに加わっていたら、エンドユーザーの懸念は軽減されていたかもしれないと思いますか？


ジェローム・パウエル
しかし、いずれにせよ、これが意見募集期間なのです。


ザック・ナン
この提案に寄せられたコメントの84％は銀行以外の事業体に関するものでした。ご存知のように、その多くは農業関係者からのもので、自分たちには何の発言権もなく、自分たちのビジネスに本当に害をなすものの受け皿になっていると感じている人たちでした。元財務長官のラリー・サマーズ氏がバーゼルについて質問され、「将来的には銀行統合に備える必要がある。

アイオワ州には資産70億ドル以下のコミュニティ・バンクが250行以上ある。アイオワ州には、資産70億ドル以下のコミュニティ・バンクが250行以上あります。アメリカ中の銀行が統合されることについて、あなたも懸念を共有していますか？


ジェローム・パウエル
コミュニティ・バンクが廃業したり、同時に統合が必要となった場合、私たちはその邪魔をすべきではないと思います。

しかし、コミュニティ・バンクが廃業したり、合併を余儀なくされたりする原因の一部になることは避けなければなりません。


ザック・ナン
私も同感です。私たちは、小規模な銀行が地域社会にサービスを提供できなくなるような事態を招きたくないのです。バーゼルIIIが2025年初頭に最終決定された場合、その実施は2026年に延期されるのでしょうか？


ジェローム・パウエル
正確なことはわかりませんが、そのようなことになるでしょう。最終ルールに至るまでには、かなり多くの仕事をこなさなければならない。その後に段階的なプロセスがあります。具体的にいつになるかはわかりません。


ザック・ナン：
ありがとうございます。私はただ、私の家族のためにタイムラインを知りたいだけなのです。2026年か、あるいは私のアドバイスで、すべてを破棄して、やり直す必要があるのかどうか。シェブロンが覆された今、FRBは、連邦政府側で過剰規制となっている分野を特定するために何かしていますか？


ジェローム・パウエル
シェブロン判決の下で、私たちは法律に従うこと、法律の実際の言葉を読み、法律にある言葉に従って解釈することに非常に重点を置いています。これが私たちのやり方です。そして......どこまで変わるかはわかりません。しかし、私たちはすでにかなり慎重に法律を解釈していると思います。

しかし、私たちはすでにかなり慎重に法律を解釈していると思います。いくつかあるので、まだ時期尚早です。今はまだ勉強しているところです。


ザック・ナン
パウエル委員長、ありがとうございました。ありがとうございます、議長。パウエル会長、ありがとうございます。


パトリック・メンリー
ノースカロライナ州選出の紳士、友人のニッケル氏に5分間スピーチしていただきます。


ウィリー・ニッケル：
どうもありがとうございました。パウエル議長、おかえりなさい。私は共和党寄りの選挙区を代表しています。我が国の歴史上、最も生産性の低い議会になりそうで、がっかりしています。しかしこの委員会は、デジタル資産、市場構造、法案、そしてステーブルコインに関して、超党派の良い仕事をしてきた。

今議会で何らかのアクションが見られるのではないかと期待しているところだ。私たちは超党派の立場で、決済用ステーブルコインを規制する法案を可決するために熱心に取り組んできました。当委員会では昨年、超党派でこの法案に賛成票を投じ、当委員会からあなたやFRBに対して、この法案を推進するために議会と協力することを優先してほしいと何度も要請してきた。

スタッフとの会話も楽しかった。ええと、今年中に安定コインの法案を完成させ、成立を支援するよう、スタッフに指示することを約束していただけますか？


ジェローム・パウエル
私たちは、このプロセスに参加できたことを本当に嬉しく思っていますし、このプロセスに参加できたことにとても感謝しています。安定したコインのための連邦政府の枠組みがあることは本当に重要だと思います。


ウィリー・ニッケル：
ありがとうございます。私が代表を務めるノースカロライナ州では、特に住宅費の高騰が住民を直撃しています。特にノースカロライナ州では深刻です。マキシン・ウォーターズ委員長は、この問題を委員会活動の最優先事項としています。ノースカロライナ州では 月収の半分以上を家賃に費やしている世帯が34万3,000世帯もあり、医療費や交通費、食費など他の出費に回せるお金はほとんどありません。

安全で手ごろな価格の住宅へのアクセスは、ノースカロライナ州だけでなく全米の労働者世帯や個人の幸福にとって不可欠です。パウエル議長、あなたが証言の中で言及された力強い経済動向にもかかわらず、住宅価格と家賃の中央値は、二〇〇二年五月以降、それぞれほぼ50％と41％上昇し、上昇を続けています。

実際、住宅コストは緩やかな賃金上昇を上回り続けている。さらに、高金利がコストに拍車をかけている。例えば、高金利は住宅建設業者にとって新築住宅の資金調達コストを高くする。また、高金利は地主の家賃値上げを招き、住宅購入予定者の住宅ローンコスト上昇につながる。

あなたやFRBの同僚たちが、インフレ率の低下を重要な目標としていることはよく承知しています。しかし、インフレの主な要因が住宅コストの上昇である現状で、金利を高く維持することは、その目標を妨げるだけだと考えたことはありますか？


ジェローム・パウエル
つまり、パンデミックの前に住宅に関していくつかのことが起こっている。そしてパンデミックがやってきて、私たちは、中長期的に住宅市場のためにできる最善のこと、最も重要なことは、インフレを抑制して金利を引き下げることだと考えています。

そうすれば、より正常な金利に戻すことができる。金利がどこに向かうかは誰にも正確にはわかりませんが、今よりは下がるでしょう。そして住宅市場の需要と供給がうまくいき、住宅が供給されるようになる。しかし、最終的には住宅不足は解消されないでしょうし、私たちの政策が金利感応的な支出を通じて機能しているのは事実です。

住宅は、住宅ローンを組んで住宅を購入するという、おそらく最も金利に敏感な支出形態です。住宅ローンによって住宅を購入するのです。そして、私たちはその市場に大きな影響を及ぼし、人々にとって厳しいものであることを知っています。しかし、これがインフレを抑える道であり、何年も何年も実を結ぶのです。


ウィリー・ニッケル：
本当にありがとう。限られた時間の中で次の質問をすることはできないと思います。でも、もしよろしければこの機会をお与えしたいと思いました。しかし、もしあなたが「経済はソフトランディングに向かっている」とおっしゃりたいのであれば、いくらでもソフトランディングと言っていただいて結構です。


ジェローム・パウエル
私は、以前から、インフレ率を下げずに、失業率を下げずに、完全な物価の安定を取り戻す道筋があると考えてきた。私たちはそれに取り組んできた。私たちはその道筋を維持することに非常に集中している。私たちは今、2つの義務に対するリスクが以前よりもはるかに均衡した状態にあると言えるでしょう。

つまり、インフレ率を下げることだけが目的ではなく、インフレ率に関する仕事は終わっていないのです。インフレ対策はまだ終わっていない。しかし同時に、労働市場の動向にも注意を払う必要がある。労働市場は依然として力強く、失業率は低い。

しかし、これは私たちが非常に重視していることであり、継続的に取り組むべきことなのです。


ウィリー・ニッケル：
ありがとうございました。


アンディ・バーです：
テキサス州からお越しのデ・ラ・クルスさんです。


モニカ・デ・ラ・クルス：
パウエル議長、本日はありがとうございます。感謝します。私はテキサス州南部の労働者階級の代表です。実際、私の選挙区はほとんどがヒスパニック系で、全米でも80％以上がヒスパニック系です。また、私の選挙区は田舎町でもあるので、今日の話題は有権者に大きく影響しますし、私にとっても個人的なことです。とはいえ、私が代表を務める住民は、連邦準備制度理事会（FRB）の調査によれば、インフレで最も大きな打撃を受けることになる人々です。

つまり、バイデンによるインフレ誘導による物価上昇は、国だけでなく、私の選挙区民も感じていることなのです。食料品店でそれを感じている。ガソリン・ポンプでも感じている。中小企業もこの状況を感じており、出費を抑え、給料を切り詰めて生活している人々は、食料品店やガソリンスタンドでのコスト増から逃れることができないのです。



モニカ・デ・ラ・クルス
小さな変化でも、私のような農村部では大きな影響を与えるのです。実際、ファーム・ビューローは最近、7月4日の物価--7月4日のお祝い--が高騰したと発表しました。見出しには「7月4日の料理費用は過去最高、インフレが裏庭を襲う」とある。このレポートによれば、費用は昨年より5％、ほんの数年前より30％上昇したとのことだ。

今、バイデン政権はこの3年間のこと、そしてそれが私の選挙区の家族に与えた苦痛を、ただ忘れてほしいと望んでいる。彼らは、なぜ人々が現在の経済状況に不満を抱いているのか理解していない。率直に言って、それは腹立たしいことであり、日常的なアメリカ人の感覚とはかけ離れている。

政府支出の暴走に対処しない限り、残念ながらインフレの暴走が続くことは明らかです。パウエル議長、過剰な政府支出は国家債務を増加させるだけでなく、インフレにも影響を与えるということを説明していただけますか？


ジェローム・パウエル
経済的なセーフティネットがあまりない場合、生活必需品に多くのお金を支払うことになり、その痛みはすぐに始まります。

それはわかります。そのような人々のために、私たちはインフレ抑制のために全力を尽くしています。インフレの原因という点では、現在のインフレは世界中の先進国が抱えているものとそれほど変わりません。

インフレの原因は、パンデミック（世界的大流行病）である。パンデミックがやってくる。私たちは経済をシャットダウンした。人々は所得の代わりに小切手を送られる。映画館にもフットボールの試合にも行けない。

だから貯蓄が増える。だから、人々はたくさんお金を使う。一方で--。


モニカ・デ・ラ・クルス
パウエル議長、あと1分しかありません。すぐにシフトチェンジしたいと思います。私は、FRBを含む連邦銀行機関は、欠陥だらけのバーゼルIII最終案を破棄し、やり直すべきだと引き続き考えている。この時点で、初めて住宅を購入する人、中小企業の経営者、そして有権者にとって一番必要なのは、おっしゃるとおり、例えば私の住む地方の低所得者層にとって一番必要なのは、資本へのアクセスが困難になることです。

パブリックコメントの97％がこの提案に否定的でした。パウエル委員長、この提案に対する圧倒的な否定的な評価は、国民の支持の欠如を示しているということに同意されますか？


ジェローム・パウエル
その通りだと思います。


モニカ・デ・ラ・クルス
ありがとう。お先に失礼します。


アンディ・バー：
コロラド州出身の ペターセンさんです


ブリタニー・ペターセン：
ありがとうございます そして、このような困難な時代におけるあなたの奉仕に感謝します。何が起こるかわからない。世界的なパンデミック、経済破綻、そして中小企業を存続させ、重要なサービスを提供し、世界で最も早く力強い回復を遂げられるようにするために、この議会が資金を投入することができた。

そして、私たちは多くのことを誇りに感じていますが、この委員会を通して、人々がコスト上昇の痛みを感じ続けていることを認識し、何度も話し合ってきました。この点についても触れていただきました。特にコロラド州では、住宅価格が大幅に上昇し、供給が不足しています。

住宅ローンの支払いができないため、人々は引っ越すことができず、また購入することもできません。ですから、金利の引き下げが住宅危機への対応に実際に役立つということをおっしゃいましたが、それでもまだ住宅供給が不足しているのです。

そこで、何が起きているのか、そして金利の引き下げはその一部でしかないのか、もう少し詳しく話していただけますか？


ジェローム・パウエル
長期的なものです。その多くは、土地や区画整理、資材や労働者の確保が難しくなっているということだ。そして、多くの大都市圏では、近郊地域はすべて建設済みです。私はワシントンDCの近くで育ちましたが、環状道路からほんの数マイル外れたところに田舎がありました。

私が生まれたときには環状線なんてなかった。でも結局のところ、住宅が足りないということなんだ。パンデミック以前もそうだったし、パンデミックによって住宅建設が遅れたのも確かだ。金利が下がれば、もっと普通の経済に戻ると思う。

しかし、住宅不足はまだ続くでしょう。


ブリタニー・ペターセン
その通りです。世界的な大流行と経済の変化からもたらされた他の影響について考えてみると、それは商業用不動産でした。地方銀行の破綻や、商業用不動産が長期的に銀行の帳簿資産にもたらすリスクを読み続けてきました。

商業用不動産が金融の安定にもたらすリスクについて、また議会として考えるべきことについて、あなたのお考えをお聞かせください。


ジェローム・パウエル
商業用不動産の状況というのは......つまり、都心部のオフィスやそれに関連する小売業などです。これは銀行がここ2、3年取り組んできたことです。それをすべてやり遂げるには、もっと時間がかかり、もっと年月がかかると思います。私たちはストレステストや私たち自身の仕事から、大銀行は大丈夫だということを知っています。

地方銀行や中小銀行のなかには、地元に不動産が集中しているような銀行もあります。そのようなことは承知しています。銀行も承知しています。監督当局はこれらの銀行に対して、資本と流動性を確保し、どれだけの資本が必要で、どれだけの損失が発生するかについて、楽観的すぎない評価をしています。ですから、私たちはこの問題に取り組んでいくことになると思います。

この問題はシステミックな問題ではないし、より広範な金融の安定を脅かすものでもない。しかし、銀行の収益性を脅かすものではあります。しかし......この問題はしばらく私たちとともにあるでしょう。私たちはこの問題を解決していくだけです。


ブリタニー・ペターセン
中小企業への融資を継続する能力も......


ジェローム・パウエル：
そうですね


そうだ
あなたは監禁されている この質問に答えるのに十分な時間はないでしょう。しかし、私の残りの未解決の質問は、最近のシェブロン判決に関するもので、そのことが、FRBが国のニーズに適応し、あらゆる場面で訴えられることなく金融の安定を確保する能力にどのような影響を及ぼすと予想されますか？


ジェローム・パウエル
私たちは今、新しい決定を見つめているところです。最も早い日だ。私は顧問弁護士の管理下で話しているが、彼に殴られるようなことはしたくない。


ブリタニー・ペターセン
"私は殴られたくない


いや..：
しかし、結局のところ、私たちは......私たちはすでに......FRBではすでに、法律の範囲内で行動することに細心の注意を払っています。私たちはその価値観に真摯に取り組んでおり、今回の判決がそれを変えることはない。私たちはこれからも、法の支配に強くコミットする機関であり続けると思います。


ブリタニー・ペターセン
素晴らしい。ありがとうございました。お先に失礼します。


ジェローム・パウエル：
ありがとう


アンディ・バー：
紳士淑女の降伏。ウィスコンシン州からお越しの フィッツジェラルド様です


スコット・フィッツジェラルド
会長、お集まりいただきありがとうございます。バーゼルIIIの話題が多くなっています。その話題を少し変えたいと思います。長期債務の提案も書き直して再提案すべきだと思います。しかし少なくとも、地方銀行が最大手銀行よりも厳しい扱いを受けないよう、法律が要求しているようにルールを調整する必要があります。

特に、地方銀行が持株会社と保険付預託機関の双方で長期債務を保有することを義務付けていることは、負担となっているように思われます。というのも、中小の地方銀行の中には、明らかに損失が出るような、よくわかりませんが、損失を吸収するような資源もあるからです。

現在の状況や今後の見通しについて、何かお考えがあればお聞かせください。


ジェローム・パウエル：
そうですね。長期債務については、コメントを募集しました。かなりの数のコメントをいただき、私たちは......私たちは......私たちは......私たちは......私たちは......スタッフはそれらを分析している。

もうひとつは、プレポジショニングです。これは割引窓口や流動性要件に近いものだと思います。それで...


スコット・フィッツジェラルド
そうですね


そうです：
まだ提案はしていません。慎重に考えているところだ。昨年春にシリコンバレー銀行や他のいくつかの銀行で起きたことから、私たちは正しい教訓を学ぼうとしています。そのひとつは、ディスカウント・ウィンドウは機能したが、それを近代化し、より効果的なものにできるということだ。

また、少なくともあの事件では、銀行の経営破綻のスピードが一段と速くなっていること、10年、15年前の銀行の経営破綻のスピードでさえ、シリコンバレーで起きたようなスピードではなかったことを学びました。ですから、私たちは流動性要件に何らかの形でそのような新しい学びを組み込む必要があるのです。

私たちはまだ提案をしていません。もちろん、提案するときには意見を求めることになるでしょう。そして、私たちはそのコメントから学びたいと考えています。


スコット・フィッツジェラルド
素晴らしい。規制の強化に直面して、銀行が住宅ローン市場から手を引いている傾向は明らかです。少なくとも私はそう解釈しています。その穴を埋めるためにノンバンクが参入してきたのです。今日、銀行はノンバンクの金融機関や、いわゆる住宅ローンの倉庫貸し出しを通じて、より広範な住宅金融システムを支えています。

しかし、私は、先ほど同僚が言及したように、バーゼル規制の一部が銀行とノンバンクの両方に害を及ぼし、住宅購入者の流動性とコストを低下させるのではないかと深く懸念しています。では、バーゼルIIIに関してお聞きしたいのですが、最終的な提案は、住宅金融の安定性を低下させる可能性があるのでしょうか？


ジェローム・パウエル
そのような意図はありません。私たちは、懸念が提起されていることは十分承知していますし、そうした懸念には細心の注意を払っています。


スコット・フィッツジェラルド
デビット・インターチェンジ手数料の上限について、小規模な発行体は免除されましたが、資産規模が100億ドル未満の発行体は、インフレ調整後のインターチェンジ収入の約35%を失ったと報告されています。デビット・インターチェンジのさらなる引き下げが、総資産100億ドル未満の小規模金融機関に与える影響を考慮しましたか？


ジェローム・パウエル：
はい。たくさんのご意見をいただき、慎重に検討しているところです。そして、私たちは確かに......私たちは確かに、あなたが提起した特定の懸念を認識しています。


スコット・フィッツジェラルド
ご存知のように、FRBのストレステストのデータ収集に使われる最新のY-14案は、銀行からノンバンクへの貸出に関するより詳細なデータを銀行に求めています。その結果、FRBが間接的にノンバンクを金融リスクから規制しようとし始めるのではないかと懸念されているのはご存知の通りです。私は今朝、そのことを懸念している人と話したばかりだ。

では、FRBはストレステスト・モデルの透明性の欠如や、意図しない結果を招く可能性について、こうした懸念が提起されていることを考えると、こうしたテストを通じてノンバンクの金融機関を間接的に規制するつもりなのでしょうか？


ジェローム・パウエル
そういうことではありません。FRBが考えているのは、ノンバンクの仲介が急速に成長しているということです。私たちはノンバンクを規制しているわけではありません。私たちはノンバンクを規制する秘密計画など持っていません。しかし問題は、私たちが規制・監督している銀行システムの内部で、どのようなリスクが保たれているのか、そしてこうした大規模なノンバンクと銀行との間にどのような関係があるのかということです。

それに対して、私たちは先入観にとらわれた答えを持っているわけではありません。私たちが理解したいのは、そのような取引関係がどのようなもので、銀行がどのようなリスクを抱えているのかということです。それだけです。


スコット・フィッツジェラルド
ありがとうございました。委員長、お先に失礼します。


アンディ・バール
ニューヨークから穏やかな女性、 ベラスケスさんは、今認識されている。


ニディア・ベラスケス：
ありがとうございます、議長。パウエル議長、今日は朝からありがとうございます。もうすぐお昼です。FRBがインフレの抑制を確認した後、中立金利に戻る道筋はどのようになるのでしょうか？


ジェローム・パウエル
FRBは、インフレ率が持続的に2％まで低下すると確信できるまでは金利を引き下げないと言ってきました。中立金利とは何かという問題は、経験則に基づくものだと思います。金融危機以前の超低金利に戻る可能性は低いと思います。

しかし、それはある意味、そこに行ってみないとわからない。


ニディア・ベラスケス
FRBの二重の使命は、物価の安定と持続可能な雇用の最大化です。FRBはインフレと利下げの可能性について考えていますが、雇用を最大化する必要性とこれらの優先事項のバランスをどのようにとっていますか？


ジェローム・パウエル
ここ数年、労働市場が非常に好調で、インフレ率も目標を大きく上回っていたため、FRBは主にインフレ率の低下に注力してきました。この2年間で、インフレ率はかなり低下しました。まだやるべきことはある。まだ目標には達していない。この仕事を続ける必要がある。

同時に、労働市場はかなり冷え込んでいます。そのため、この2つの目標はバランスが取れていると言えるでしょう。つまり、政策の観点からは、この2つの目標に注意を払う必要があるということです。ここ2、3年は、インフレ率にほとんど注意を払わなければならなかったのですから。


ニディア・ベラスケス
パウエル委員長、956条に関するルール作りについて、今後の公聴会のたびに最新情報を求めると申し上げました。前回の3月の公聴会以来、パウエル議長のお仲間の規制当局数社が規則案を発表しました。なぜFEDはこの提案に署名しなかったのですか？


ジェローム・パウエル
私たちが行っているのは、インセンティブ報酬に関連する現状を調査することです。ご存知のように、私たちは2010年からすべての銀行を対象としたガイダンスを導入しており、このガイダンスを中心にかなり重要な監督を行っています。そのため、2010年当時とはかなり様相が異なっています。ですから、2010年当時の状況とは異なり、現在の状況はどうなっているのか、そして残存リスクに対処するためにどのような提案をすればいいのかを自問しているのです。


ニディア・ベラスケス
以前の公聴会では、規則を作成するためには問題をよりよく理解する必要があるとおっしゃっていましたね。リザラガSEC委員は6月の講演で、金融危機に至るまで、給与体系が短期的な利益を最大化する大きな賭けを奨励する一方で、金融システム全体を崩壊させる恐れのある、より長期的なリスクを無視することがしばしばあったことはよく知られている、と述べました。

さらに、前回のご登場以来、お仲間の規制当局の何人かが規則案の提出に向けて動き出しています。なぜ、同僚の規制当局やリザラガ委員は問題の範囲を理解できたのに、FRBは理解できなかったのでしょうか？


ジェローム・パウエル
世界金融危機以前のインセンティブ報酬の慣行が良いものでなかったことは、誰もが認めるところだと思います。しかし、私たちは2010年に、すべての銀行を拘束するインセンティブ報酬に関するガイダンスを公表しました。

そのガイダンスには多くの検討がなされ、現在ではそのガイダンスに基づいて監督を行っています。現在、銀行のインセンティブ報酬をめぐる状況は、世界金融危機以前とはまったく異なっています。


ニディア・ベラスケス
他の規制当局はこのことを理解できているのに、あなたはできていない。しかし、言わせてもらえば、これは議会の委任がどのように機能するかということではありません。ドッド・フランク法の全規則制定条項のうち、強制的なものは148しかなく、そのうち制定後1年以内の期限があるものは22しかない。956条はそのひとつであり、規則を発行することはあなた方の義務であるという結論に達していただきたい。

ありがとうございました。


ジェローム・パウエル
156条は規則かガイダンスを要求しています。規則もガイダンスも必要ありません。ありがとうございます。


ANDY BARR：
フロリダ州からお越しのドナルズさんです。


バイロン・ドナルズです：
ありがとうございます。パウエル長官、お会いできてうれしいです。いろいろな分野をカバーしましょう。経済分析局によると、バイデン大統領が就任して以来、物価は家庭の所得を上回り続けており、現在では19.3％上昇しているのに対し、平均週間所得は14.6％しか増加していません。

この手に負えない経済危機を生み出す上で、政府支出はどのような役割を果たしたのでしょうか？


ジェローム・パウエル
ドアを閉めてください。すみません、ドアが開くとよく聞こえないんです。


BYRON DONALDS：
繰り返します 大丈夫です


ジェローム・パウエル：
いいえ、私はあなたを聞いた。


バイロン・ドナルド：
OK. OK


ジェローム・パウエル：
それを閉じる必要があります。この話の中で、政府支出はどのような役割を果たしたのでしょうか。パンデミック（世界的大流行）が起こり、私たちは経済を閉鎖し、そして再開した。そして、世界のいたるところでインフレが始まりました。


バイロン・ドナルズ
大統領とその予算は、連邦政府支出を5％以上増加させるというものですが、これはアメリカ国民の懐を悩ませている頑固なインフレをさらに悪化させることになると思いますか？


ジェローム・パウエル
大統領の予算について私がコメントするのは不適切でしょう。


バイロン・ドナルズ
パウエル議長、私が質問する唯一の理由は、明らかに連邦準備制度理事会（FRB）は議会から出される財政政策の様々な側面に対応しなければならないからです。大統領の予算にかかわらず、連邦政府の支出を5％、10％、15％増やすことは、現在の環境において適切でしょうか？


ジェローム・パウエル
正直なところ、それは選挙で選ばれた代表者への質問です。私たちは財政政策に関与していません。


バイロン・ドナルズ
そうですね。財政政策が米国の金融政策を管理するFRBの能力に影響を与えるというのが、あなたと連邦準備制度理事会の見解ですか？


ジェローム・パウエル
私たちは財政政策を当然のこととして受け止めており、コメンテーターではありません。私たちは議会予算局でも管理予算局でもありません。ここでどんな財政政策が起ころうとも、それについてコメンテーターになる機会はすべてお断りします。それは、私たちが立候補しなかったからです。そのような仕事はしていない。

私たちは自分たちの編み物に専念している。私たちが無所属であるということは、私たちの任務、つまり、現状の経済に対処することに忠実であるかどうかにかかっているのです。


バイロン・ドナルズ
アメリカの財政政策が、あなた方に対処すべき多くのこと、そしてそれに伴うさまざまな負担を与えたと主張したい。残念ながら、あなた方はそれに対処しなければなりませんが、本当に対処しなければならないのはアメリカの消費者なのです。話を先に進めよう。金融政策報告書では、労働力の供給を改善した主な要因の一つとして、移民の回復を挙げている。

しかし、労働力率は依然として大流行前の水準を下回っている。あなたの知る限り、増加した外国生まれの労働供給のうち、不法移民によるものは何パーセントですか？


ジェローム・パウエル
もう一度言ってください。


BYRON DONALDS：
外国人労働者の何パーセントが不法移民によるものですか？


ジェローム・パウエル：
外国人労働者のすべてが移民によるものだと思います。


いいえ、不法移民です：
いいえ、不法移民です。


ジェローム・パウエル：
不法だ すみません、聞き取れませんでした。


BYRON DONALDS：
そうです


ジェローム・パウエル：
私はその答えを知らない。


BYRON DONALDS：
そうですね 連邦準備制度理事会（FRB）が今後どうすべきかを議会に助言する上で、重要なことのひとつだと思います。パウエル議長、ひとつ包括的な質問をさせてください。過去15年間の金融政策を比較すると、金利は明らかに上昇しています。

FRBは、今後1～2年の間に、50bpでも100bpでも、金利が引き下げられる可能性はあると予想していますか？


ジェローム・パウエル
パンデミック（世界的大流行）の影響がすべて終息したとき、金利はどこに落ち着くのかということだと思いますが、それは誰にもわかりません。これは素晴らしい議論だ。しかし、私の感覚では、世界金融危機とパンデミックの間の、金利が非常に低く、インフレ率が非常に低かったあの時代には、おそらく戻れないだろうと考えています。

極めて低かった。ヨーロッパの主要国では10年物国債金利がマイナスになった国もありました。しかし、そこまで低い金利に戻るとは思いません。中立金利のようなものは、ゆっくりと動く力によって動いていると考えています。しかし、結局のところ、効果は見えています。

私たちの政策金利は現在5％を超えており、政策が制限的であるように感じられますが、激しい制限的ではありません。


バイロン・ドナルズ：
わかりました。ありがとうございました。お先に失礼します。


ジェローム・パウエル：
ありがとう


スコット・フィッツジェラルド

ジョシュ・ゴッタイマー
シャーマンさん、ありがとうございます。パウエル委員長、あなたはカストディ資産はオフバランスシートであり、常にそうであったとおっしゃいました。


ジェローム・パウエル
もう一度言ってください


ジョシュ・ゴッタイマー
あなたは、カストディ資産はオフバランスシートであり、常にそうであると言いました。その言葉を支持しますか？


ジェローム・パウエル：
一般論としてはそうです


ジョシュ・ゴッタイマー
SECのStaff Accounting Bulletin 121は銀行業務の中核であるカストディに影響を与えるものです。同公報は、銀行が保管するデジタル資産を貸借対照表に計上することを求めており、事実上、銀行は市場から完全に排除されることになります。連邦準備制度理事会（FRB）と証券取引委員会（SEC）は、SAB121の影響について話し合ったことがありますか？また、この政策に対するあなたの考えをお聞かせください。


ジェローム・パウエル
ご存知のように、SECの方針についてはコメントしません。SECも私たちの方針についてはコメントしません。だから、あなたがSEC121にコメントすることは分かっていましたが、正直なところ、それはSECの問題であって、私たちの問題ではありません。


ジョシュ・ゴッタイマー
ありがとうございます。先月、あなたはインフレデータを評価する際、賃金の伸びが生産性を上回っているかどうかを考慮すると言いました。1979年から2019年にかけて、中間層の労働者の生産性は約60％上昇しましたが、賃金は約16％上昇しました。明らかに生活が苦しい家庭に対して金利を引き上げるかどうかを検討する際に、この歴史的なギャップを考慮しますか？


ジェローム・パウエル
インフレ率と最大限の雇用を考えています。それが私たちの目標です。私たちには、あなたがおっしゃるようなことをするためのさまざまな手段はありません。もちろん、長期的なトレンドはよく理解しています。

しかし、ベネフィットも分析に含めなければなりません。今、賃金の話が出ましたね。


ジョシュ・ゴッタイマー
ありがとうございます。ありがとうございます。議長、昨日、国家情報長官が、イラン政府関係者は、現在進行中の抗議行動を好機と捉えようとしている、と述べました。ガザでの戦争について 引用終わり イラン政府関係者がネット上で活動家を装い、抗議活動を奨励し、抗議活動家に資金援助まで行っていることが確認された、とのことです。

私は下院情報特別委員会のメンバーとして、敵対勢力が我々の金融システムに干渉してくることを同様に懸念している。金融機関を通じた外国からの干渉を調査し、対処するために、他の連邦機関と協力しているかどうか、あなたのコミットメントをお聞かせいただけますか？


ジェローム・パウエル
私たちは、特に職員レベルでは、そのようなことの多くに参加しています。ご存知のように、情報機関には多くの重点が置かれており、それは銀行や商業銀行、そして我々にとっても非常に有益です。しかし、私たちがそうした問題に非常に注力していることは確かです。我々は強力なチームを持っている。もちろん、サイバー・リスクについては眠れるものではありません。

しかし、私たちは戦い続けています。


ジョシュ・ゴッタイマー
ディスカウント・ウィンドウに話を移したいと思います。委員長、ディスカウント・ウィンドウの運営は時代から遅れていると聞いています。また、割引窓口を近代化し、その利用を促進するための努力は、関連するスティグマを軽減しない限り、効果がないという声も聞き続けています。

割引窓口の使い勝手は、流動性を必要とする銀行にとって重要なツールである。流動性を必要とする銀行にとって、割引窓口をより現実的な選択肢とするための取り組みがどのような形で進められているのか、教えていただきたい。


ジェローム・パウエル
つまり、いくつかのことが必要なのです。まず、インフラを近代化する必要があります。私たちのシステムにおける割引窓口は、信用の主要な供給源ではありません。銀行が特定の状況下で利用できる資金源なのです。しかし、インフラが少々疲弊していることは承知しており、私たちはそれに投資し、より使いやすくするなどの努力をしています。

これは大きなプロジェクトです。すみません、2つ目のポイントはスティグマ（汚名）です。スティグマ、これは難しいですね。これは難しい。スティグマを克服する方法はたくさんあります。私たちはそのすべてを研究しています。ある意味で、銀行に割引窓口の利用を義務付ければ、スティグマを解消することができます。

つまり、これは大きな要求ですが、議会が割引窓口の利用者の名前を公表するよう求めたとき、それは何の役にも立ちませんでした。というのも、銀行は基本的に割引窓口を利用しないと言っているからです。私たちは、人々が自由にディスカウント・ウィンドウを利用できるようにしたいのです。

ですから、私たちは長い間この問題に取り組んできましたが、なかなか進展しませんでした。


ジョシュ・ゴッタイマー
ありがとうございました。お先に失礼します。ありがとうございました。


スコット・フィッツジェラルド
お戻りください。それでは、ニューヨークの紳士、ローラー氏に5分間の発言をお願いします。


マイク・ローラー：
ありがとうございます、議長。パウエル議長、私の知る限りでは、あなたとバイデン大統領との最後の公開会談は2022年5月31日に行われました。それは正確ですか？


ジェローム・パウエル
あなたの言葉を信じます


マイク・ローラー：
わかりました それ以来、大統領と個人的な面会はありましたか？


ジェローム・パウエル：
いいえ


いいえ
大統領との電話は？


ジェローム・パウエル：
私はそうは思わない。


ありません
大統領と会ったり話したりしなかった理由はありますか？


ジェローム・パウエル：
どんな大統領でも、あなたに電話すれば、来て会うものです。




マイク・ローラー
インフレに悩まされ、コストがコントロールできない中、バイデン大統領は2年以上あなたに会いたいと言わなかったのですか？


ジェローム・パウエル
私は彼と会談していない。彼は会談を求めていませんし、もちろん私も会談を求めていません。だから、あなたは日付を持っている。


マイク・ローラー：
しかし、あなたの知る限り、この2年間、大統領と話したり会ったりしたことはまったくないのですね？


ジェローム・パウエル：
一度だけ並んで握手したことがありますが、あれは会話ではありません。ただ、大統領閣下、それだけでした。国賓晩餐会でのことだった。数カ月前に国賓晩餐会に出席したとき、握手をして、こんばんは、大統領閣下、それだけでした。


マイク・ローラー
大統領があなたに会おうとしないのは奇妙だと思いませんか？


ジェローム・パウエル：
まったく まったく


アル・グリーン：
議長？議長？議会質問をお願いします 議長 認められますか？


スコット・フィッツジェラルド
質問をどうぞ


アル・グリーン：
ありがとうございます 議長 私は、規則第17条第4項に基づき、この紳士の発言は乱暴であり、合衆国大統領候補者の人格を否定的に反映している限りにおいて、礼儀作法と討論の規則に違反していることを指摘します。


スコット・フィッツジェラルド
その下院議員は今のところ、人格に関わるようなことはしていませんし、誰かについて何かを質問したこともありません。何をおっしゃりたいのですか？議員を認めます

ご質問にお答えします お答えしましょうか？


マイク・ローラー：
ありがとう


アル・グリーン：
議長、議事進行を続けたいと思います。


スコット・フィッツジェラルド：
何ですか？


アル・グリーン：
委員長、私たちはこの委員会で、大統領選に立候補している人物を否定的に映すような発言をしてはならないと諭されてきました。これにはトランプ氏も現大統領も含まれます。


マイク・ローラー
ランキング・メンバーは、2025年のとんでもないプロジェクトについて、冒頭の独白でまくしたてたのではありませんか？


アル・グリーン：
議長、あなたが裁定するまで、私の友人を議事録から除外していただけませんか？


スコット・フィッツジェラルド
ローラー氏は大統領を諌めたり、否定的なことは一切言っていません。私は彼のコメントを聞いただけです。そこで、ニューヨーク選出のローラー議員を再登場させます。


マイク・ローラー
ありがとうございます。パウエルさん、あなたは私の質問に答えようとしていましたね。


ジェローム・パウエル：
私たちは独立した機関です。政権は連邦政府を非常に尊重しており、影響を与えようなどとは考えていません。そして、私はそれがまったく珍しいことだとは思わない。私は今年で13年目になりますが、連邦準備制度理事会の議長が大統領と会わない時期が長く続くこともあると思います。


マイク・ローラー
わかりました。あなたはFRBの独立性について言及されましたが、私はあなたがその独立性に誇りを持っていることを知っていますが、あなたは、あるいはFOMCのメンバーは、9月の利下げが選挙のわずか30日から60日前に政治的と見なされる可能性があることを認めていますか？


ジェローム・パウエル
ですから、私たちの任務は、データ、入ってくるデータ、進展する見通し、リスクのバランスに基づいて、必要なときに必要なだけ決断を下すことであり、他の要因を考慮することではありません。政治的要因も含まれます。我々はそうした決断を下す。選挙期間中も含め、私たちはそうした決断を下してきた長い歴史があります。

それが私たちの仕事です。私たちが何をするにしても、それは非常に根拠のあるものです。いずれにせよ、私たちが選挙サイクルについて考えるビジネスに関わるのは適切ではありません。


MIKE LAWLER：
2023年5月から2024年5月までのインフレ率は前年比で3.3％上昇しました。エネルギー・インフレは3.7％上昇。食品インフレは2.1％の上昇です。インフレが引き続き課題となっていますが、現時点で利下げの可能性はありますか？


ジェローム・パウエル
CPIはPCEに対して異常に高い水準で推移しています。この25年間、FRBは個人消費支出インフレ、PCEインフレに焦点を当て、通常、CPIとのギャップはわずか25～30ベーシスポイントでした。現在のPCEは、ヘッドラインが2.6％、コアが2.6％となっている。

私たちは長い間、政策緩和を検討するためのテストを行ってきました。そのテストとは、インフレ率が2％ではなく、2％まで持続的に低下していく道筋をより確信できるようになることです。これが私たちが明確にしたテストです。

私は、先ほど申し上げたように、インフレは下降基調にあると確信しています。しかし、私たちは十分な自信があるとは言っていません。


マイク・ローラー：
例えば、ウェストチェスター郡では、住宅ローンは天文学的な価格になっています。例えば、私が代表を務めるウェストチェスター郡では、住宅ローンの平均額は毎月1,000ドル、年間12,000ドル以上も上昇しています。残された時間で簡単な質問をします。

大統領との面会で、精神的あるいは認知的な衰えを感じましたか？


ジェローム・パウエル
いいえ


いいえ

アル・グリーン：
議事進行上の問題です


スコット・フィッツジェラルド

アル・グリーン：
紳士的な発言の後、すぐに発言してください。


スコット・フィッツジェラルド
私は、大統領の個人的な発言やコメントに関与しないよう、会員に注意を促します。

しかし、議長、もしよろしければ、私の注文として、米国大統領候補を否定的に反映する限りにおいて、紳士の言葉を削除することを要求します。


スコット・フィッツジェラルド
ニューヨークからお越しのローラー氏です。


マイク・ローラー：
私の発言は、誰もが理解していることですが、喜んで撤回します。


アル・グリーン：
議長？


スコット・フィッツジェラルド
発言を撤回します グリーンさん、認めます。


アル・グリーン：
私は、議長、彼の最後のコメントは、誰もが理解していると思います。私の意見では、それでは、彼が撤回しようとする前の状態に戻ってしまいます。彼が適切な撤回をする気があるのなら、私は要求しませんが、撤回するまでは、彼の言葉を削除することを要求します。


スコット・フィッツジェラルド
時間切れです


アル・グリーン：
議長、私が行った要請、つまり議事進行上の問題については、時間切れにはなりません。時間切れではありません。

テキサス州選出の紳士、グリーン氏の持ち時間は5分です。


アル・グリーン：
議長、本日はありがとうございます。お元気でお過ごしのことと思います。今があなたにとって困難な時期であることは承知していますし、率直に言って、あなたは何年もの間、困難な時期を過ごしてきました。

いくつかお聞きしたいことがあります。その前に、シリコンバレーとシグネチャー・バンクの失敗の後、失敗後の教訓レポートがありました。あの報告書はかなり重要だと思いました。その失敗後の教訓報告書の重要性は？


ジェローム・パウエル：
重要です。私たちは正しい教訓を学び、規則だけでなく、何よりも監督実務に正しい変更を加えたかったのです。


AL GREEN：
シリコンや他の銀行で起こったような事件が起こるたびに、このようなことが重要だとお考えですか？


ジェローム・パウエル：
私たちは皆、謙虚であるべきだと思いますし、出来事から学ぼうとしています。


アル・グリーン
ありがとうございます。次の質問ですが、小規模な銀行についてです。総資産が50億ドル未満の銀行は、システミック・リスクの例外が発動されると、FDICの特別査定の対象となります。それを免除してほしい。

何かご意見はありますか？


ジェローム・パウエル
FDICの実務の問題です。ですから、FDICが口を出すことではありません。


アル・グリーン
わかりました。では次にお願いします。時間切れになりましたので、コメントを最後までお願いします。あなたはパンデミック（世界的大流行）についてコメントし、パンデミックがこのインフレをもたらしたと述べていましたが、途中で止められてしまいました。パンデミックとインフレで実際に何が起こったのか、一般の人々がよりよく理解できるように、もう一度説明していただけますか？


ジェローム・パウエル
ですから、喜んでそうしたいと思います。年月が経てば経つほど、何が起きていたのかがはっきり見えてくると思います。しかし、今振り返ってみると、大まかに言えば、パンデミックの間、政府は経済活動を支援するために多くのことを行った。

そして、この先本当に深刻な経済不況が起こるかもしれないという理論に基づいていた。その後、経済は再開し、非常に力強く再開した。今にして思えば、財政政策や金融政策が需要を下支えし、供給が制約されていたことがわかると思います。

自動車は作れなかった。サプライチェーンは混乱していた。多くのものが不足していた。その結果、アメリカはインフレに見舞われ、他の国よりも需要面で大きな打撃を受けたのです。その後、ウクライナで戦争が起こり、私たちよりもヨーロッパに大きなインフレが起こった。

そして私たちの考え、当時の私の考えは、制限的な金融政策が必要で、パンデミックによる供給側と需要側の歪みが解消されるまで時間がかかるというものだった。2023年はそのようなことが起こった年だった。サプライチェーンは固定化され、労働力不足は大幅に緩和され、失業率は非常に低いままだった。

昨年はインフレ率が大幅に低下し、成長率も非常に高い水準を維持した。このテーゼが証明されたような年だった。そして今、2024年を迎えているわけですが、私たちは、インフレ対策をやり遂げることを約束し、同時に強力な労働市場を維持することを約束しています。

そのバランスを取りながら政策を進めていかなければなりません。しかし、このようなインフレがどこから来たのか、私たちはよりよく理解できるようになったと思います。私たちが予想していたように、それは需要と供給の組み合わせでした。


アル・グリーン
最も大きな要因の2つは、パンデミックとウクライナとの戦争でしたね？


ジェローム・パウエル：
そして、パンデミックが財政と金融の大きな反応を呼び起こし、それが本当に力強い活動やインフレに貢献したことは間違いありません。


アル・グリーン
もし金融政策がなければ、反実仮想的ですが、恐慌に陥っていたでしょうか？


ジェローム・パウエル
当時、私たちはそう考えていましたし、主流派のエコノミストたちは、文字通り世界経済を一定期間停止させ、その後再開させようとしたことはなかったのではないかと非常に懸念していたと思います。どれくらいの時間がかかるのか、うまくいくのか、わからなかったのです。


アル・グリーン
ありがとうございました。

ありがとうございます、議長。パウエル議長、本日の証言に感謝します。本日の公聴会における私の質問ポイントは、おそらく多くの内容がカバーされていると思いますが、重要な質問を2度目、3度目とすることは決して悪いことではありません。理事会のメンバーがボズウェル案の改訂版をパブリック・コメントに付すことを希望し、FDICおよびOCCとそのプロセスを進めていることを改めて説明されました。私から見ると、FDICは不透明な時期にあります。

現議長は信頼回復のために辞任を表明し、後任は上院の承認公聴会を待っているところです。OCCでは、まだ上院で承認されていない会計検査官代理がいる。少なくとも、大幅な改定が予想される以上、完全な再提案が適切であることに他省庁が同意することを望みます。

そこで委員長、このような再提案がどのようなスケジュールで行われる可能性があるのか、教えていただけますか？


ジェローム・パウエル
かなり不透明ですが、やってみます。


フランク・ルーカス
お願いします


ジェローム・パウエル：
他の2つの機関との話し合いは非常に建設的なもので、今後も続けていきたい。私たちは本質的な部分ではかなり合意しており、あとはプロセスについてです。つまり、ベースラインとしては、ある種の再提案について合意することかもしれない。

そうすれば、そうなる可能性もある。その提案書を作成するのに時間がかかり、それを60日間公開する。そうですね......おそらく秋の半ばまでは無理だと思います。それから、たとえば60日間コメントを募集する。そしてコメントを得る。

そのコメントを評価し、慎重に考えなければならない。それを経て最終版を書き上げるわけですが、それには時間がかかります。そうなると、おそらく来年以降になると思います。先ほど申し上げたように、これらのルールは銀行が長い間付き合っていかなければならないルールです。

急ぐべきものではありません。時間をかけて、きちんとしたものにし、意見を聞く必要がある。これは非常に大きな規制の一部だ。多くのことを変更する必要がある。いいこともたくさんある。良い提案をしたい。


フランク・ルーカス：
2024年のストレステストでは商業用不動産リスクに焦点が当てられました。その結果、金融システムの健全性が示されたことに同意されますか？


ジェローム・パウエル
はい、そう思います。


フランク・ルーカス
自国の人々は常にインフレを懸念していますし、最近も基本的な生活必需品だけでなく、ビジネスを行うためのコストやその他の問題についても懸念しています。事実、インフレ率は依然としてFRBの目標値である2％を上回っており、ここ数年、食料品やエネルギーの大幅な値上がりが続いている。

以前にもお話ししたように、私は1977年、カーター時代のインフレ期に若い農家としてスタートし、その後、ボルカー議長の劇的な金融引き締めを経験しました。

担保は十分にあったのですが、資本が利用しやすいという点ではお買い得でした。だから、インフレに効果的に対処しなければ、制御不能に陥る可能性があることを、その世代の一員である私は特に敏感に感じている。過去の過ちを繰り返さないようにインフレに対処するアプローチについて、もう少し詳しく教えてください。

私は過去の過ちを避けたいのです。


ジェローム・パウエル
私たち二人が経験した70年代の高インフレから得た大きな教訓のひとつは、中央銀行がそのケースに対処し、仕事をし、そしてそれが完全にうまく、本当に行われるようにしなければならないということです。

信じられないかもしれないが、それは十分に受け入れられていなかったし、必ずしもそう考えられていなかった。また、当時は中央銀行の独立性はあまり尊重されていなかった。だから、ポール・ボルカーが勇気を持ってそれを実行したことは、より称賛に値する。ですから、私たちは今、中央銀行で働く人々にとって、このことは内面的な教訓となっています。

我々はそれを理解している。私たちはインフレ率を持続的に2％まで低下させることを約束します。


フランク・ルーカス
残された時間で最後の質問です。あなたやFRB幹部は、この秋の選挙の前日にも、選挙の翌日にもそこにいるでしょう。FRBの責任を注意深く見守っているのは、これまでと同じ人たちですよね？


ジェローム・パウエル
FRBでの大統領選挙は4回目です。翌日には出勤し、自分の仕事をしています。


スコット・フィッツジェラルド
時間切れです。カリフォルニア州選出のシャーマン氏にお願いします。


ブラッド・シャーマン
COVIDを終えて、誰もがソフトランディングは不可能で、景気後退は避けられないと言いました。私はあなたと政権を称賛したい。私たちはソフトランディングを見たようだ。失業率は歴史的に低く、有色人種の失業率も歴史的に低い。

また、この1年半の間に、消費者物価指数によるインフレ率が4.7ポイント低下しました。これは最大の下落率なのか、それとも......あなたは計算したことがないかもしれませんが、私は計算しました。今世紀に入ってからの18ヵ月間で最大の下落率だ。

これに反対する理由はありますか？


ジェローム・パウエル
そうであってほしい。あなたがそう言ってくれるのはうれしい。私は......私は......その発言を検証することはできないが。


BRAD SHERMAN：
その計算をする優秀なスタッフがいると思いますし、願わくばプレスリリースを見たいと思います。昨日イエレン長官が来日した際、私はあなたと彼女の双方が懸念すべき問題を取り上げました。私は常に、政治的な理由で銀行が金融サービスを提供しない、あるいは提供しないかもしれないという「チョークポイント作戦」に反対してきた。

フロリダ州とテネシー州では、銀行口座の開設や融資を拒否された人に、政治的理由によるものだと主張する手段を与える法律が可決された。

ですから、フロリダ州とテネシー州の法律が、疑わしい金融状況に対処する我々の能力に悪影響を及ぼさないよう、長官と協力していただきたい。あなたには二重の使命があります。財政赤字は物価の安定と雇用、つまり失業を低く抑えることに大きなリスクをもたらすからです。

財政赤字は物価の安定と雇用、つまり失業を低く抑えることに大きなリスクをもたらすからです。財政赤字は物価の安定と雇用に大きなリスクをもたらす。しかし、2つの点で財政赤字に劇的な影響を与える。連邦政府は世界史上最大の借り手である。金利は財政赤字に影響する。そして、時には1,000億ドルもの利益を連邦政府に渡している。

ですから、あなた方の最初の2つの職務が、少なくともあなた方の政策が財政赤字にどのような影響を与えるかを見なければならないことを意味しているかどうか、考えていただきたいのです。私は...バーゼルIIIの再公布とそれを主張することを望みます。バーゼルIIIについては、他の2つの規制当局と交渉中ですよね。プライス・ウォーターハウス・クーパースによる最近の評価では、当初の提案は中小企業にとって借入コストの上昇につながることが示された。

バーゼルIIIは、あらゆる面で、銀行に対して、金利リスクのあるウォール街に資金を投入し、信用リスクがあるから地元のメインストリートの企業には資金を貸すな、と言っているように見えた。実際、公正なシステムを導入すれば、売却可能な債券だけでなく、すべての債券を時価評価することになる。

また、バーゼルIIIをやり直す際には、エネルギー税額控除（グリーンエネルギー税額控除）を現在の低所得者向け住宅税額控除と同じように扱い、証券業界、特に地方債への影響に留意し、地方企業に対して「上場企業なら65％しかカウントしない」と不公平にならないようにしてほしい。

その点は評価されていますね。しかし、率直に言って、80％のローン・トゥ・バリューと90％のローン・トゥ・バリューで民間住宅ローン保険が適用された場合、銀行はほとんど同じリスクにさらされます。デビットカードについてひとつお聞きします。不正防止に対応するための追加手数料は、確か0.3ドルだったと思いますが。

詐欺 -- 詐欺が急増しています。FRBは提案を最終決定する前に、不正防止調整金の増額を検討するのでしょうか。


ジェローム・パウエル
それはインターチェンジ・ルールに関して寄せられたコメントの一部です。それは私たちが認識している懸念事項です。その点は考慮します。


ブラッド・シャーマン
お先に失礼します。


ロジャー・ウィリアムズ
お戻りください。ミズーリ州選出のルトケマイヤー議員に5分間の発言を認めます。


ブレイン・ルートケマイヤー
ありがとうございます、議長。私は、カリフォルニア州選出の思慮深い紳士のいくつかの発言に感謝しています。しかし、パウエル議長がおっしゃったように、第3の暗黙の義務として、実際に予算と協力することがあるのでしょうか。私は、予算に影響を与えることができるのは議会だけだと思っていました。

私たちがそうです。立法府でもなく、行政府でもなく、司法府でもなく、予算を扱うのは立法府です。私の思い違いでしょうか？


ジェローム・パウエル
その通りだと思います。


ブレイン・ルートケマイヤー
私は...私は...私は...私は...私は...私は...私は...私は...


ジェローム・パウエル：
そうだ


そうだ
ここ数週間で私の机の前に出てきたことの1つは昨年、国中のいくつかの議会が連邦銀行法を侵害する銀行法を可決し始めたことです。これはご存知ですか？ご存知ですか？どうお考えですか？あなたの考えを聞かせてください。


ジェローム・パウエル
正直なところ、見たことはありませんし...


ブレイン・ルートケマイヤー
そうですか


ジェローム・パウエル：
私のデスクに来るとは限らない。バー副議長の机の上を通るかもしれません。


ブレーン・ルトケマイヤー：
そうか というのも、あなたは銀行の規則や規制をたくさん扱っていますよね。その職務と責任、そして......法的な能力を......州に簒奪させたくないんです。


ジェローム・パウエル：
これは先取りの問題ですか？


ブレイン・ルートケマイヤー：
そうです、先取りの問題です。


ジェローム・パウエル：
ええ、それは......OCCにとっては大きな問題で......


ブレイン・ルートケマイヤー：
そうだ


ジェローム・パウエル：
ご存知のように


ブレーン・ルトケマイヤー：
だから、あなたがそれについて何か交差させたいかどうか、それについて何か考えがあるかどうか、ちょっと興味があるんです。


ジェローム・パウエル：
それはない


ブレーン・ルートケマイヤー：
そうですか 先ほど、中小企業委員会の公聴会を終えたばかりなのですが、そこに住宅建設業者や請負業者がいて、規制のコストについて話していました。基本的に、1,000ドルのコスト増で約10万ドルのコストがかかる。

だから、規制のコストという点では、この点が重要なのです。行政手続法に該当しますか？


ジェローム・パウエル
そうです


そうです：
では、その法律の一部は、規制のコスト、つまり法令順守のコストを決定することですね？


ジェローム・パウエル：
私はその答えを知りません。


わかりました：
わかりました


ジェローム・パウエル：
しかし、私たちがAPAに注意深く従っていることは知っています。


わかりました
しかし、私にとっては、規則や規制をどのように見るかという観点から、コストが経済的利益を上回らないようにすることが本当に重要なポイントなのです。つまり、これは分析の一部でなければならないと思います。


ジェローム・パウエル
確かに、私たちは......私たちの規則を可能な限り効率的にし、仕事を成し遂げようとしています。


ブレイン・ルートケマイヤー
私たちが懸念していることのひとつは、紳士がここでクレジットカードの規制IIについて話していたと思います。シェブロン・ドクトリンが基本的に取り消されたことで、最近の規則、たとえばReg IIの手数料やバーゼル規則などに関する規則作りにどのような影響があるのでしょうか。

また、バーゼル規則のような最近のルール作りにはどのような影響があるのでしょうか？


ジェローム・パウエル
つまり、ダービン修正案のもとでインターチェンジ・ルールを行うという私たちの任務は変わりません。ですから、私たちは......私たちは......私たちは機関として常に法律の遵守に重点を置いています。私たちは非常に法律を遵守するグループです。


ブレイン・ルートケマイヤー
しかし、それが法律や規則といったものを超えたり、解釈し直したりする能力を狭めることになるのでしょうか？私には、それこそがルールの目的だと思えるのですが......。


ジェローム・パウエル
そうですね、それは裁判所の問題でしょう。つまり、裁判所も同じ質問をするだろう。


ブレイン・ルートケマイヤー
そうだ


ジェローム・パウエル：
その法律について。それが私たちの問いです。しかし......彼らが言っているのは、裁判所が政府機関をあまり尊重しなくなるということです。


ブレイン・ルートケマイヤー：
そうですね


ジェローム・パウエル：
繰り返しになりますが、これらの......これらの決定が下されたばかりです。私は先週、これが起きている間、国外にいた。だから、私は......。だから、私は......私はここで推測しているようなものだ。


ブレイン・ルートケマイヤー
わかりました。最後の質問です。昨日イエレン長官にこんな質問をしました。夜眠れないのはなぜですか？最大の関心事は何ですか？経済や銀行システムに関するあなたの責任について、最大の懸念は何ですか？


ジェローム・パウエル
長い間、私は......それはサイバーでした。その理由は、私たちは信用危機や金融危機について知っているからです。しかし、大手金融機関や金融市場のユーティリティ企業に対するサイバー攻撃が成功した例はありません。それが私の答えです。

実は今、私が夜も眠れないほど悩んでいることの第1位は、前にもお話ししたように、インフレ率が低下し、労働市場が冷え込むという重要な時期に差し掛かっていることです。インフレ率を2％まで下げたいが、強力な労働市場も維持したい。

それを実現するための最善のチャンスを与えるような決断を下すこと、それが私が早朝に考えることです。


ブレイン・ルートケマイヤー
以前にも話したことがあります。需要を押し下げようとする立場からすれば、本当に大変な仕事だ。そして政権は、これだけのお金を使うことで、需要を押し上げようとしている。本当に大きな枠の中に入ってしまったね。ありがとうございます。議長。お先に失礼します。


ロジャー・ウィリアムズ
お戻りください イリノイ州からお越しの フォスター議員です フォスター議員の持ち時間は5分です。


ビル・フォスター
議長、パウエル議長、ありがとうございます。物事がうまくいっているときこそ、現在のように、カーブの周囲を見渡し、夜も眠れないようなリスクを見抜くことが私たちの責務だと思います。ですから、ルエトケマイヤー代表の質問には感謝しています。ここ数年、SRT（シンセティック・リスク・トランスファー）やクレジット・リンク債への関心が高まっています。



ビル・フォスター
SRTの買い手は銀行が提供するレバレッジを利用してSRTに投資している可能性があり、その場合、リスクは銀行システムにブーメランのように跳ね返ってくる可能性があります。率直に言って、この記事を読んだとき、金融危機時のクレジット・デフォルト・スワップに関するAIGの件でPTSDが引き起こされた。米連邦準備制度理事会（FRB）がSRTの承認に一役買っていることは理解していますし、実際、昨年秋にはSRTの発行に関して米銀にガイダンスを出しました。

このような投資が銀行にとってリスクを軽減する安全な方法となりうるのか、また、どのような点で危険な伝染源となりうるのか、少しお聞かせください。


ジェローム・パウエル：
もちろん、あなたもご存知のように、連鎖のいくつかの場所で破綻が起こる可能性があります。ひとつは、リスクが買い手にうまく完全に移転されていないことです。最初のステップは、銀行が理解できるような形で、無条件にリスクをバランスシートから取り除くことです。

銀行がそれを行うことができれば、それは良いことです。問題は、そのリスクが融資という裏口から戻ってくるかどうかです。私たちはそれをよく理解しています。銀行はこうした案件を私たちに持ち込んでくる傾向があり、私たちはそれを注意深く見ています。私たちは、このような問題が起こりうることをよく理解しています。しかし、結局のところ、それが銀行のバランスシート上のリスクを減らすことにつながるのであれば、私たちはそれでいいのです。


ビル・フォスター
連邦準備制度理事会（FRB）はどのような見識を持ち、どのような管理をしているのでしょうか?


ジェローム・パウエル
私の理解では、これは銀行との非常に活発な対話です。彼らはこの件がどのように扱われるのか知りたがっている。彼らは、自分たちに跳ね返ってくるようなこと、あるいは私たちがその扱いを否定するようなことはしたくないのです。ですから、こうしたことがどのように機能するかについては、かなり透明性の高いやりとりが行われていると思います。

私たちが考える要件は非常に明確です。これは私が聞いていることであり、私たちは前回の失敗を見ました。銀行も含めて、誰も同じことは繰り返したくないと思います。


ビル・フォスター
もしあなたが、特にノンバンクで伝染の連鎖の一部となる可能性のある特定の分野について、もっと可視化する必要があると結論付け、積極的に研究しているのであれば、ぜひ教えてください。また金融危機が起こる前に死ぬことが私の個人的な目標であり、そうすれば私は自分の仕事を全うしたことになるからです。

さて、米国におけるストレスの価値は比較的小さく、その大部分はオフショアであることも理解しています。国際的にこのような業務が増加していることを注視していますか？また、国際的な伝染病が再び忍び寄る可能性があるという点で、何か初期のトラブルの兆候を示すようなものはありますか？


ジェローム・パウエル：
そのようなことは聞いていませんが、確認してお知らせします。


ビル・フォスター
AIGが倒産したときの現実的な問題は、数十億の欧州の銀行が直ちに自己資本規制に抵触することでした。では、現時点での流動性案の時間的な見通しはありますか？


ジェローム・パウエル
主なことは、バーゼル3に関する非常に重要なプロジェクトがあるということです。そのひとつが流動性に関する提案です。具体的な時期については申し上げられませんが、今年の終わりごろを目標に取り組んでいるところです。


ビル・フォスター
今年の終わりには、その最初の見解が出るということですか？


ジェローム・パウエル：
そう思います。


そう思います：
わかりました。バーゼル3（新改正案）については、まだ各機関間で交渉中だと思いますが、方向性としては、現行の自己資本規制を弱める方向になるのでしょうか、それとも強化される部分もあるのでしょうか？


ジェローム・パウエル
いや、バーゼル3と整合的な自己資本要件と、バーゼル3と整合的な増資が......。


ビル・フォスター
質問なのですが、当初の提案と今回の提案を比べると、現状に近い方向に進んでいるのでしょうか？もしそうであれば、補間してください。もし、あなたが出した提案に対するコメントがあり、現状に対するコメントを理解し、その中間にいるのであれば、もうコメントは必要ないのかもしれません。


ジェローム・パウエル
もう少し複雑ですが、基本的にはその通りです。現在の資本水準があり、提案があり、多くの金メッキが施されている。


ビル・フォスター
なぜもっとコメントが必要なのですか？


ジェローム・パウエル：
その答えは......。その答えは、多くの異なる部分があるということだ。ただ...


ビル・フォスター：
ありがとう。そして、私は時間をオーバーして...


ロジャー・ウィリアムズ
時間切れです 次に、インディアナ州選出の女性下院議員、フーチンさんの5分間です。


エリン・ホウチン
ありがとうございます 議長 パウエル議長、本日はありがとうございます。長い一日でしたので、ずっとお集まりいただきありがとうございました。金融業界の最大の強みのひとつは、銀行システムの多様性です。普通預金口座を開設するにしても、中小企業を立ち上げるためにローンを組むにしても、アメリカ人にとって選択肢と選択の幅を維持することがいかに重要か、私は身をもって知っています。

しかし、銀行業界の統合が進み、中小の金融機関が生き残ることが難しくなっています。その理由のひとつが、多くの中小銀行が直面している過剰な規制負担だ。これは、流動性要件やバーゼル3最終基準のようなものに対する新たな提案や調整という形でもたらされることもありますが、規制当局の技術的能力の時代遅れや、審査プロセスの非効率性などによる場合もあります。

パウエル委員長、あなたが規制する銀行が不必要な負担に直面しないようにするために、連邦準備制度理事会（FRB）がテクノロジーや調達手続きのアップグレード、研修の更新のためにどのようなステップを踏んでいるのか、お話しいただけますか。


ジェローム・パウエル
ご指摘の通り、国内の銀行数は40年前から減少しており、様々な理由で統合が進んでいます。私たちはそれを助長しようとはしていません。また、規制による固定費の高騰がその理由のひとつであることも認識しています。

ですから、特に小規模な金融機関については、そのことを念頭に置くようにしています。ITや具体的なことについてのご質問ですが、具体的な監督実務に詳しい者をお招きして、また機会を改めてお伺いしたいと思います。妥当な質問だと思います。


エリン・ホウチン：
そうですね。そうですね。参考までに、私は今年初め、「Fostering the Use of Technology to Uphold Regulatory Effectiveness in Supervision Act（監督における規制の実効性を強化するためのテクノロジーの活用を促進する法律）」あるいは「FUTURES Act（FUTURES法）」という法案を提出できたことを誇りに思っています。この法案は、連邦銀行規制当局に対し、彼らが使用しているテクノロジーや研修システムが改善され、特に中小金融機関の負担が軽減されることを確認するための評価を実施することを義務付ける重要な法案です。

同時にこの法案は、規制当局が最新のフィンテック技術革新に対応することで、金融システムの安全性と健全性を強化するものです。だから私は、この法案（Futures Act）が今年の初めにマークアップを通過したことをうれしく思っている。近いうちに採決が行われることを期待しています。

パウエル議長、昨日の上院でのコメントでは、バーゼル3規則の最終化に向けて進む前に、有意義な見直しが必要だとおっしゃっていました。バーゼル3に対するパブリック・コメントの97％が否定的で、その86％が銀行セクター以外からのものであったことを考えると、このようなお言葉をいただけて嬉しく思います。

今日ここにいる私の同僚の多くが、バーゼル3に対する懸念を表明しています。インフレや金利上昇、住宅市場の失速など、米国人がすでに直面している重圧を考えると、私は、このルールの累積的な影響を、大手の金融機関だけでなく、より広範な経済や中小規模の銀行との関連において、じっくりと検討することを強く求めたい。

インディアナ州南部の私のような農村地域にとって必要不可欠な中小金融機関にとって、過剰な規制がもたらす苦難を考慮した有意義な見直しは行われるのでしょうか。


ジェローム・パウエル
そうだと思います。


そう思います：
銀行セクターの統合を懸念していますか？40年間も続いているとおっしゃっていましたね。銀行セクターの統合に懸念はありますか？また、累積的なルールがもたらす広範な影響が、銀行部門のさらなる統合につながる可能性を懸念していますか？


ジェローム・パウエル
繰り返しになりますが、私たちは統合の一因になりたくはありません。しかし、統合は有機的に進んでいるように思われます。例えば、私たちは州をまたいだ銀行業務を許可しました。また、長い間、銀行業には規模の経済があまりないことが知られていたと思います。しかし、技術革新が進み、そのような古い常識は通用しなくなってきています。

実際、中小の地方銀行の多くは、大手の地方銀行と競争するためには成長する必要があると感じていると思います。また、皆さんもご存知のように、30年前にはなかったような多くの地域に、最大手の銀行が進出しています。ですから、ビジネスの観点からは規模の拡大が必要であり、私たちは統合を推し進めたくはないのです。

また、銀行が最大手銀行と競争するために必要なことであれば、その邪魔もしたくないと考えています。


ERIN HOUCHIN：
ありがとうございます。パウエル議長、証言ありがとうございました。わが国の金融システムは、まさに世界の羨望の的です。私たちは、小規模な金融機関や成長中の金融機関が過度な負担を負うことなく、技術革新に必要な手段を確保できるようにする必要があります。今回の有意義な改革において、その点を強調していただいたことに感謝いたします。

ありがとうございました。


ジェローム・パウエル
ありがとうございました。


ロジャー・ウィリアムズ
次に、今朝ワシントンD.C.でマイル走の記録を樹立したイリノイ州出身のキャステン氏に5分間の発言を認めます。


ショーン・キャステンです：
ありがとうございます。議長、今朝お会いしたときは、私よりもずっとお元気そうで、毛並みもよかったです。パウエル議長、またお会いできてうれしいです。バーゼル3改革について簡単にお話ししますと、税制優遇措置について、また、クリーンエネルギー税制優遇措置が他の税制優遇措置に比べて4倍のリスク・ウェイトを課せられていることについて、パウエル委員長とお話ししました。

もし提案があるのであれば、クリーン・エネルギー税額控除が従来の100％のリスク・ウェイトに戻るかどうか、お聞かせいただけますか？


ジェローム・パウエル
通常の取り決めでは、すべてが合意されるまでは何も合意されないからだ。だから、具体的な内容には触れたくない。私は、3つの機関がすぐに全パッケージを発表できることを期待しています。


SEAN CASTEN：
わかりました。そうですね、早ければ早いほど、一時的なものであっても、参加したいという銀行がたくさんありますから。それはありがたい。2021年、あなたは気候変動に関連した金融リスクに関するFSOCの報告書に参加されたと思いますが、その報告書では初めて気候変動が米国の金融安定にとって新たな脅威であると指摘されました。

今でもその結論に賛成ですか？


ジェローム・パウエル
その結論とは何ですか？


ショーン・キャステン
気候変動は米国の金融安定にとって新たな脅威である。


ジェローム・パウエル：
そうだ


OK：
そうですね。ご存知のように、私はこの4月のブルームバーグの報道で、私たちが書いた手紙のいくつかに悩まされたからだ。第二に、連邦準備制度理事会、OCC、FDICは、バーゼル委員会の気候変動リスク管理の主要原則の実施を、融資による排出の除去に限定するよう働きかけていた。

そして3つ目は、米国は他国と異なり、どの銀行に対しても、信用リスク評価に気候変動リスクをどのように組み込んでいるかを分析することを提案しなかったことである。バーゼル委員会の気候変動リスクに関する業務を弱めようとした代表者はいますか。例えば、バーゼル委員会が気候変動リスクに関する業務に関して、その権限を逸脱しているとの懸念を表明したことも含めて。


ジェローム・パウエル
バーゼル委員会には、エネルギー転換の促進や気候変動への対応という任務はありません。北欧の銀行の中には、そのように感じているところもある。実際、北欧の銀行にはそれがあります。しかし、私たちにはそれがありません。


SEAN CASTEN：
しかし、気候変動が銀行システムの安定に対する新たな脅威であることに同意するのであれば、権限がないから行動しないのか、それとも2021年に述べたことに同意できないから行動しないのか、どちらなのでしょうか？


ジェローム・パウエル
金融の安定に対する新たな脅威があることには同意する。それは時間が経てば分かることです。私は、気候変動との戦いを銀行機関に期待するのは大きな間違いだと思います。それは選挙で選ばれた人々の仕事だと思います。米国にはそのような権限はない。私たちができることは非常に限られており、監督する金融機関がそうしたリスクを認識し、管理できるようにすることだけです。

私たちは、金融機関に移行計画やそのようなものを強制的に採用させるようなことはしません。法律が改正されない限り、銀行監督機関を通じてそのようなことが行われることはないでしょう。


SEAN CASTEN：
では、気候変動は金融リスクであり、銀行を規制するというのが世界の見解であるならば、米国のG-SIBsは報告を義務付けられるべきではないというのが連邦準備銀行の見解なのでしょうか？


ジェローム・パウエル
繰り返しになるが、我々はFRBの気候政策決定者になるつもりはない。そんなことをするつもりはない。そのような権限はない。私たちの独立性の鍵は、あなた方から与えられた仕事に忠実であることです。私たちが気候を発見し、よし、気候に関する闘いをリードするぞ、と言うべきだという考えは、ただ......そのようなことをするのであれば、私たちは財務省の一部であるべきです。


SEAN CASTEN：
はっきり言って、誰もあなたが環境保護庁だと錯覚しているわけではありません。しかし、私は昨日ジャネット・イエレンとこの件について話しました。ご存知のように、アメリカの富の3分の1から4割は不動産に結びついています。しかし、2008年の金融危機では、G-SIBから他の事業体のバランスシートにリスクが移動した。

保険会社だから責任はない、と。しかし、我々はそれを修正した。システム内にシステミック・リスクが存在する場合、保険会社はその責任を負わなければならなくなったのです。問題は、システミック・リスクがシステム内を移動していることが分かっている場合、FSOCはそのリスクを監視しているのか、それともFSOCは「見ることが許されていないのであれば、見るつもりはない」と考えているのか、ということです。それは他人事だ。

なぜなら、ここに座っているのは他の誰かなのですから。


ジェローム・パウエル
つまり...


SEAN CASTEN：
私たちは 責任を負うことになる そのリスクが生じたとき -- 鶏がねぐらに帰るとき


そうですね..：
銀行はリスクを熟知している。銀行や保険会社は沿岸部での融資を控えるでしょう。


そうですね：
しかし、そのリスクをどこに転嫁するのでしょうか？


ジェローム・パウエル：
つまり...


つまり..：
もし......もしそうなら......ファニーとフレディにリスクを押し付けているのを見たことがある。ファニーとフレディがそれを再保険業界に押し付けようとしているのを見たことがある。リスクは上がらないのです。


ロジャー・ウィリアムズ
時間切れです


ジェローム・パウエル：
私たちは彼らを規制していません。


ロジャー・ウィリアムズ：
時間切れです


ショーン・キャステン：
降参します


ロジャー・ウィリアムズ：
次に、偉大なるミズーリ州出身の女性、ワグナー下院議員の 発言を5分間認めます。


アン・ワグナー：
議長、ありがとうございます。野球に例えて言えば、私はクリーンアップのバッターです。パウエル議長、午後はようこそお越しくださいました。パウエル議長、あなたの証言の中で、引用しますと、「長期的なインフレ期待は依然としてよく固定されているようだ」と述べられました。もう少し詳しくお聞かせください。


ジェローム・パウエル
私たちやエコノミスト、中央銀行の考え方では、国民がインフレについてどのような期待を抱いているかは本当に重要です。というのも、もしインフレ率が低いと予想するのであれば、おそらくインフレ率は低くなるでしょう。

私たちは、個人、企業、市場参加者を調査しています。


アン・ワグナー：
わかりました。


ジェローム・パウエル：
そして、市場調査を行います。市場のさまざまな商品を通じて、インフレ率の市場予測を導き出すこともできます。そのどれもが、長期的にはインフレ率が2％前後になると予想していることを示唆している。そしてそれは、このエピソードを通して非常に安定している。


アン・ワグナー
長期的とおっしゃいますが、何年後を想定されていますか？1年、3年、5年、何かありますか？


ジェローム・パウエル：
短期・中期のインフレ予想も見ています。そして、それらはより変動しやすい。なぜなら、インフレ率が高いとき、人々はそれが数年続くと考えるからです。しかし、1つの標準的なことは、5年、5年を見ることです。年目から10年目までです。それが標準的な見方であり、それよりも長期的な見方でもある。

つまり、インフレ率は2％の水準まで下がると信じているということです。


アン・ワグナー
ありがとうございます。最近、シュリンクフレーションに関する報道がありました。視聴者のために言っておくと、昨日と同じ値段のものを買うのに、以前より少ない量しか買えなくなることです。私のポテトチップスの袋のようなものだ。私たちが経験したインフレの苦しみから目をそらし、代わりにコスト上昇や圧力に直面している生産者を非難しようとする人もいる。

しかし、最近の金融政策報告書には、インフレの原因としてシュリンクフレーションが挙げられているのを見たことがない。さらに、昨年の労働統計局の記事では、シュリンクフレーションについて検討し、再度引用するが、「全体的なインフレに与える影響はごくわずかである」と結論づけている。パウエル議長、FRBの見解と分析から、シュリンクフレーションは、過去数年間のインフレの暴走の中で、アメリカの労働者と家計におそらくより大きな痛みを押し付けてきた、重要な、あるいはさりげない、あるいは増幅させる要因だったのでしょうか？


ジェローム・パウエル
いいえ。つまり、私たちは......私はこう言いたいのですが、アメリカでは......食品やその種のもののパッケージには、そのものの中身が開示されます。そして価格はその通りになる。消費者はそれを買うか買わないかを選択できる。しかし、それがインフレの主な要因だとは考えていません。


アン・ワグナー：
生産者の立場からすれば、おそらくそうだと思います。もし、その商品のコストが指数関数的に高ければ......。


ジェローム・パウエル
生産者側のコストを反映しているのかもしれない。おそらくそうだろう。しかし、それがインフレの原因だということにはなりません。


アン・ワグナー
わかりました。ありがとうございます。話題を変えますが、連邦準備制度理事会（FRB）は過去10年にわたり、デビット・インターチェンジ手数料の上限がもたらす悪影響を強調する研究を数多く行ってきました。その研究を行ったエコノミストの何人かは、この規則案、Reg IIにも携わっています。パウエル議長、規制IIが低コストの当座預金口座に悪影響を及ぼすことを示した以前の連邦準備制度理事会（FRB）の調査には欠陥がありましたか。

それとも結論が間違っていたのでしょうか？もしそうでないなら、すべての調査が有害な影響を実証しているのに、なぜFRBはこの規則制定を提案したのでしょうか？


ジェローム・パウエル
どのような調査を指しているのかよくわかりません。それについては喜んでフォローアップさせていただきます。


アン・ワグナー：
そうですね。インターチェンジフィーの上限やReg IIについて議論しているのは知っています。FRBが発表した調査によると、ここ数年、インターチェンジ・フィーの上限はかなり悪影響を及ぼしているようです。

そこで、もしよろしければ、その点についてお答えいただければと思います。それと、カード・ノット・プレゼント取引に対する新しいデュアル・ルーティング義務化の結果、デビットカード発行会社が被ることになる詐欺コストの増加について、なぜFRBは対策を講じないのでしょうか？

もう時間がありません。もし文書でお答えいただけるのであれば、ありがたく存じます。以上です。

ありがとうございます。パウエル議長の本日の証言に感謝いたします。そろそろお帰りになってはいかがでしょうか。異議なく、すべての議員は5立法日の間に、証人に対する追加質問を議長に書面で提出することができます。質問は証人に転送され、証人が回答する。

パウエル議長におかれましては、2024年8月30日までにご回答くださいますようお願いいたします。以上をもちまして、本審問会を閉会いたします。
