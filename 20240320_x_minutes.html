class="valign"><tr><th>Latest Minutes<br></th><th>Prior Minutes<br></th></tr><tr><td>In conjunction with this FOMC meeting, participants submitted their projections of the most likely outcomes for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation for each year from 2024 through 2026 and over the longer run.</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>The projections were based on their individual assessments of appropriate monetary policy, including the path of the federal funds rate.</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>The longer-run projections represented each participant's assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy.</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>A Summary of Economic Projections was released to the public following the conclusion of the meeting.</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>In their discussion of inflation, participants observed that significant progress had been made over the past year toward the Committee's 2 percent inflation objective even though the two most recent monthly readings on core and headline inflation had been firmer than expected.</td><td>In their discussion of inflation, participants observed that inflation had eased over the past year but remained above the Committee's 2 percent inflation objective.</td></tr><tr><td>Some participants noted that the recent increases in inflation had been relatively broad based and therefore should not be discounted as merely statistical aberrations.</td><td>They remained concerned that elevated inflation continued to harm households, especially those with limited means to absorb higher prices.</td></tr><tr><td>However, a few participants noted that residual seasonality could have affected the inflation readings at the start of the year.</td><td>While the inflation data had indicated significant disinflation in the second half of last year, participants observed that they would be carefully assessing incoming data in judging whether inflation was moving down sustainably toward 2 percent.</td></tr><tr><td>Participants generally commented that they remained highly attentive to inflation risks but that they had also anticipated that there would be some unevenness in monthly inflation readings as inflation returned to target.</td><td>While the inflation data had indicated significant disinflation in the second half of last year, participants observed that they would be carefully assessing incoming data in judging whether inflation was moving down sustainably toward 2 percent.</td></tr><tr><td>In their outlook for inflation, participants noted that they continued to expect that inflation would return to 2 percent over the medium term.</td><td>Participants observed that longer-term inflation expectations had remained well anchored at a level consistent with the Committee's 2 percent inflation objective.</td></tr><tr><td>They remained concerned that elevated inflation continued to harm households, especially those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation.</td><td>Participants observed that longer-term inflation expectations had remained well anchored at a level consistent with the Committee's 2 percent inflation objective.</td></tr><tr><td>A few participants remarked that they expected core nonhousing services inflation to decline as the labor market continued to move into better balance and wage growth moderated further.</td><td>Measures of near-term inflation expectations had also declined recently, in some cases to within their ranges in the years before the pandemic.</td></tr><tr><td>Participants discussed the still-elevated rate of housing services inflation and commented on the uncertainty regarding when and by how much lower readings for rent growth on new leases would pass through to this category of inflation.</td><td>Some participants pointed to reports from contacts that firms could not as easily pass on price increases to consumers or were making less frequent price adjustments than they had in recent years.</td></tr><tr><td>Several participants noted that the disinflationary pressure for core goods that had resulted from the receding of supply chain bottlenecks was likely to moderate.</td><td>Some participants pointed to reports from contacts that firms could not as easily pass on price increases to consumers or were making less frequent price adjustments than they had in recent years.</td></tr><tr><td>Other factors related to aggregate supply, such as increases in the labor force or better productivity growth, were viewed by several participants as likely to support continued disinflation.</td><td>Participants observed that longer-term inflation expectations had remained well anchored at a level consistent with the Committee's 2 percent inflation objective.</td></tr><tr><td>Some participants reported that business contacts had indicated that they were less able to pass on price increases or that consumers were becoming more sensitive to price changes.</td><td>Some participants pointed to reports from contacts that firms could not as easily pass on price increases to consumers or were making less frequent price adjustments than they had in recent years.</td></tr><tr><td>Some participants observed that longer-term inflation expectations appeared to remain well anchored, as reflected in a broad range of surveys of households, businesses, and forecasters, as well as measures from financial markets.</td><td>Measures of near-term inflation expectations had also declined recently, in some cases to within their ranges in the years before the pandemic.</td></tr><tr><td>Participants expected that economic growth would slow from last year's strong pace.</td><td>However, participants noted that the economic outlook was uncertain and that they remained highly attentive to inflation risks.</td></tr><tr><td>With regard to the household sector, participants noted that consumption spending generally remained solid, although many commented that recent readings on retail sales had been soft.</td><td>However, participants noted that the economic outlook was uncertain and that they remained highly attentive to inflation risks.</td></tr><tr><td>Several participants pointed to the strong labor market, ongoing wage gains, and a generally healthy household-sector balance sheet as likely to continue to support consumption.</td><td>Accordingly, they expected that supply and demand in product and labor markets would continue to move into better balance.</td></tr><tr><td>Participants noted mixed reports about the pace of homebuilding amid still-elevated financing costs for developers, despite strong housing demand and a limited supply of affordable housing.</td><td>Regarding the economic outlook, participants judged that the current stance of monetary policy was restrictive and would continue to put downward pressure on economic activity and inflation.</td></tr><tr><td>Some participants noted that increased immigration, which had likely been boosting the growth of personal consumption spending, may also have been adding to the demand for housing.</td><td>Accordingly, they expected that supply and demand in product and labor markets would continue to move into better balance.</td></tr><tr><td>Many participants pointed to indicators such as higher credit card balances, greater use of buy-now-pay-later programs, or rising delinquency rates on some types of consumer loans as evidence that the finances of some lower- and moderate-income households might be coming under pressure; these developments were seen by these participants as a downside risk to the outlook for consumption spending.</td><td>In light of the policy restraint in place, along with more favorable inflation data amid ongoing improvements in supply conditions, participants viewed the risks to achieving the Committee's employment and inflation goals as moving into better balance.</td></tr><tr><td>Reports from business contacts in some industries and Districts conveyed increased optimism about the outlook, while contacts in a couple of other Districts reported only a steady or stable pace of economic activity.</td><td>In a few Districts, contacts reported that the pace of economic activity was steady or solid, while in several others, contacts expressed increased optimism about the economic outlook and prospects for investment.</td></tr><tr><td>Restrictive credit conditions were cited by a few participants as restraining sectors such as equipment investment and residential investment.</td><td>A few participants remarked that financing and credit conditions were particularly challenging for small businesses.</td></tr><tr><td>However, several participants noted that their contacts had reported increased investment in technology or in business process improvements that were enhancing productive capacity and helping businesses ameliorate the effects of a tight labor market.</td><td>District reports from manufacturers were mixed, as some contacts saw increased activity, whereas others saw subdued or weakening activity.</td></tr><tr><td>Manufacturing activity was characterized as stable.</td><td>The reports of business contacts cited by participants varied across industries and Districts.</td></tr><tr><td>A couple of participants noted that high input costs and lower expected commodity prices were weighing on farm incomes.</td><td>A couple of participants noted that alÂ­though soft commodity prices and elevated borrowing costs had contributed to a decline in farm incomes recently, agricultural land values remained resilient, and delinquencies on farm loans continued to be low.</td></tr><tr><td>Participants assessed that demand and supply in the labor market were continuing to come into better balance, although conditions generally remained tight.</td><td>Participants noted that the labor market remained tight, but demand and supply in that market had continued to come into better balance.</td></tr><tr><td>Participants noted strong recent payroll growth, while the unemployment rate remained low.</td><td>Payroll growth had remained strong in the last few months of 2023 but had slowed from its pace seen a year ago, while the unemployment rate remained low.</td></tr><tr><td>Participants cited a variety of indicators that suggested some easing in labor market conditions, including declining job vacancies, a lower quits rate, and a reduced ratio of job openings to unemployed workers.</td><td>Participants also observed that the ratio of job openings to unemployed workers had declined over the past year but still remained somewhat above its pre-pandemic level.</td></tr><tr><td>Some participants indicated that business contacts had reported less difficulty in hiring or retaining workers.</td><td>Consistent with a reduction in labor market tightness, business contacts in several Districts reported an easing in wage pressures or an increased ability to hire and retain workers.</td></tr><tr><td>Several participants noted that the better balance between labor supply and demand had contributed to an easing of nominal wage pressures.</td><td>Consistent with a reduction in labor market tightness, business contacts in several Districts reported an easing in wage pressures or an increased ability to hire and retain workers.</td></tr><tr><td>Nevertheless, some participants observed that portions of the labor market, such as the health-care sector and in less urban areas, remained very tight.</td><td>While labor market conditions were generally seen as strong, several participants noted that recent job gains were concentrated in a few sectors, which, in their view, pointed to downside risks to the outlook for employment.</td></tr><tr><td>Most participants noted that, during the past year, labor supply had been boosted by increased labor force participation as well as by immigration.</td><td>Participants mentioned several developments that had boosted labor supply last year, including higher labor force participation, immigration, and an improved job-matching process; however, a few participants judged that further increases in labor supply may be limited, pointing, for instance, to the decline in labor force participation in December.</td></tr><tr><td>Participants further commented that recent estimates of greater immigration in the past few years and an overall increase in labor supply could help explain the strength in employment gains even as the unemployment rate had remained roughly flat and wage pressures had eased.</td><td>Participants mentioned several developments that had boosted labor supply last year, including higher labor force participation, immigration, and an improved job-matching process; however, a few participants judged that further increases in labor supply may be limited, pointing, for instance, to the decline in labor force participation in December.</td></tr><tr><td>Participants discussed the uncertainties around the economic outlook.</td><td>Participants discussed the uncertainty surrounding the economic outlook.</td></tr><tr><td>Participants generally noted their uncertainty about the persistence of high inflation and expressed the view that recent data had not increased their confidence that inflation was moving sustainably down to 2 percent.</td><td>As an upside risk to both inflation and economic activity, participants noted that momentum in aggregate demand may be stronger than currently assessed, especially in light of surprisingly resilient consumer spending last year.</td></tr><tr><td>Some participants pointed to geopolitical risks that might result in more severe supply bottlenecks or higher shipping costs that could put upward pressure on prices, and observed that those developments could also weigh on economic growth.</td><td>Participants also noted some other sources of upside risks to inflation, including possible disruptions to supply chains from geopolitical developments, a potential rebound in core goods prices as the effects of supply-side improvements dissipate, or the possibility that wage growth remains elevated.</td></tr><tr><td>The possibility that geopolitical events or surges in domestic demand could generate increased energy prices was also seen as an upside risk to inflation.</td><td>Participants also noted some other sources of upside risks to inflation, including possible disruptions to supply chains from geopolitical developments, a potential rebound in core goods prices as the effects of supply-side improvements dissipate, or the possibility that wage growth remains elevated.</td></tr><tr><td>Some participants noted the uncertainties regarding the restrictiveness of financial conditions and the associated risk that conditions were or could become less restrictive than desired, which could add momentum to aggregate demand and put upward pressure on inflation.</td><td>Furthermore, several participants mentioned the risk that financial conditions were or could become less restrictive than appropriate, which could add undue momentum to aggregate demand and cause progress on inflation to stall.</td></tr><tr><td>Several participants commented that increased efficiencies and technological innovations had the potential to raise productivity growth, which might allow the economy to grow faster without raising inflation.</td><td>A few participants mentioned the possibility that economic activity could surprise to the upside and inflation to the downside because of more-favorable-than-expected supply-side developments.</td></tr><tr><td>Participants also noted downside risks to economic activity, including slowing economic growth in China, a deterioration in conditions in domestic CRE markets, a potential reemergence of stresses in the banking sector, or the possibility that a pickup in layoffs could result in a relatively rapid rise in unemployment.</td><td>Downside risks to inflation and economic activity noted by participants included geopolitical risks that could result in a material pullback in demand, possible negative spillovers from lower growth in some foreign economies, the risk that financial conditions could remain restrictive for too long, or the possibility that a weakening of household balance sheets could contribute to a greater-than-expected deceleration in consumption.</td></tr><tr><td>Many participants pointed to the difficulty in assessing how recent immigration trends would influence the evolution of labor supply, aggregate demand, and overall economic activity.</td><td>A few participants mentioned the possibility that economic activity could surprise to the upside and inflation to the downside because of more-favorable-than-expected supply-side developments.</td></tr><tr><td>In their consideration of monetary policy at this meeting, all participants judged that, in light of current economic conditions, the outlook for economic activity and inflation, and the balance of risks, it was appropriate to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 5-1/4 to 5-1/2 percent.</td><td>In light of current economic conditions and their implications for the outlook for economic activity and inflation, as well as the balance of risks, all participants judged it appropriate to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 5-1/4 to 5-1/2 percent at this meeting.</td></tr><tr><td>Participants also agreed that it was appropriate to continue the process of reducing the Federal Reserve's securities holdings, as described in the previously announced Plans for Reducing the Size of the Federal Reserve's Balance Sheet.</td><td>All participants also judged it appropriate to continue the process of reducing the Federal Reserve's securities holdings, as described in the previously announced Plans for Reducing the Size of the Federal Reserve's Balance Sheet.</td></tr><tr><td>Participants commented that maintaining the current target range for the federal funds rate at this meeting would support the Committee's progress to return inflation to the 2 percent objective and keep longer-term inflation expectations well anchored.</td><td>In light of current economic conditions and their implications for the outlook for economic activity and inflation, as well as the balance of risks, all participants judged it appropriate to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 5-1/4 to 5-1/2 percent at this meeting.</td></tr><tr><td>In discussing the policy outlook, participants judged that the policy rate was likely at its peak for this tightening cycle, and almost all participants judged that it would be appropriate to move policy to a less restrictive stance at some point this year if the economy evolved broadly as they expected.</td><td>In discussing the policy outlook, participants judged that the policy rate was likely at its peak for this tightening cycle.</td></tr><tr><td>In support of this view, they noted that the disinflation process was continuing along a path that was generally expected to be somewhat uneven.</td><td>They pointed to the decline in inflation seen during 2023 and to growing signs of demand and supply coming into better balance in product and labor markets as informing that view.</td></tr><tr><td>They also pointed to the Committee's policy actions together with the ongoing improvements in supply conditions as factors working to move supply and demand into better balance.</td><td>Many participants remarked that the Committee's past policy actions and ongoing improvements in supply conditions were working together to move supply and demand into better balance.</td></tr><tr><td>Participants noted indicators pointing to strong economic momentum and disappointing readings on inflation in recent months and commented that they did not expect it would be appropriate to reduce the target range for the federal funds rate until they had gained greater confidence that inflation was moving sustainably toward 2 percent.</td><td>Participants generally noted that they did not expect it would be appropriate to reduce the target range for the federal funds rate until they had gained greater confidence that inflation was moving sustainably toward 2 percent.</td></tr><tr><td>Participants remarked that in considering any adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate at future meetings, they would carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks.</td><td>Participants noted that the future path of the policy rate would depend on incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks.</td></tr><tr><td>Participants noted the importance of continuing to communicate clearly the Committee's data-dependent approach in formulating monetary policy and the strong commitment to achieve its dual-mandate objectives of maximum employment and price stability.</td><td>Several participants emphasized the importance of continuing to communicate clearly about the Committee's data-dependent approach.</td></tr><tr><td>In discussing risk-management considerations that could bear on the policy outlook, participants generally judged that risks to the achievement of the Committee's employment and inflation goals were moving into better balance.</td><td>In discussing risk-management considerations that could bear on the policy outlook, participants remarked that while the risks to achieving the Committee's employment and inflation goals were moving into better balance, they remained highly attentive to inflation risks.</td></tr><tr><td>They remarked that it was important to weigh the risks of maintaining a restrictive stance for too long, which could unduly weaken economic activity and employment, against the risks of easing policy too quickly, which could stall or even reverse progress in returning inflation to the Committee's 2 percent inflation objective.</td><td>A couple of participants, however, pointed to downside risks to the economy associated with maintaining an overly restrictive stance for too long.</td></tr><tr><td>Regarding the latter risk, participants emphasized the importance of carefully assessing incoming data to judge whether inflation is moving down sustainably to 2 percent.</td><td>Most participants noted the risks of moving too quickly to ease the stance of policy and emphasized the importance of carefully assessing incoming data in judging whether inflation is moving down sustainably to 2 percent.</td></tr><tr><td>Participants noted various sources of uncertainty associated with their outlooks for economic activity, the labor market, and inflation, with some participants additionally mentioning uncertainty about the extent to which past monetary policy actions or the current stance of policy would weigh further on aggregate demand.</td><td>Participants highlighted the uncertainty associated with how long a restrictive monetary policy stance would need to be maintained.</td></tr><tr><td>Participants agreed, however, that monetary policy remained well positioned to respond to evolving economic conditions and risks to the outlook, including the possibility of maintaining the current restrictive policy stance for longer should the disinflation process slow, or reducing policy restraint in the event of an unexpected weakening in labor market conditions.</td><td>In particular, they saw upside risks to inflation as having diminished but noted that inflation was still above the Committee's longer-run goal.</td></tr></table></h1>
