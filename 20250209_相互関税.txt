*********I'll be announcing, probably Tuesday or Wednesday, at a news conference, reciprocal tariffs. And very simply, it's, if they charge us, we charge them. That's all. When is it going to be in effect, sir? Almost immediately. But I'll be announcing the details of it, highly detailed, and it'll be great for everybody, including the other countries. But if they are charging us 130 percent and we're charging them nothing, it's not going to stay that way. It won't affect everybody, because there's somewhere we have similar tariffs, but the ones that are taking advantage of the United States, we're going to have a, it's reciprocity, it's reciprocal. We're going to have a reciprocal. We'll also be announcing steel tariffs on Monday. On this? Tomorrow? Monday, yeah. Tomorrow. What countries will those go on? Everybody. Steel. Including Canada and Mexico? Yeah. Steel coming into the United States is going to have a 25 percent tariff. What about aluminum, sir? Aluminum too. 10 percent? No, 25 percent. 25 for aluminum. 25. For both. I'm committed to buying and owning Gaza. As far as us rebuilding it, we may give it to other states in the Middle East to build sections of it. Other people may do it through our auspices, but we're committed to owning it, taking it, and making sure that Hamas doesn't move back. We're trying to end that war. It's a war that would have never happened if I were president. It would have never happened, but we're making progress. I've had it. Let's just say I've had it. And I expect to have many more conversations. We have to get that war ended. It's going to end, and we have to get it ended. And we have to get it ended so it should have never happened, would have never happened if I was president.
