*********We'll have, I think, some very fair — all we want is a fair deal. And you know, there's a word, reciprocal. I'd go right now, reciprocal tariffs on everybody. Because many of the countries that you feel so horrible about, the way they're being treated by Trump, you're saying, oh, President Trump is so terrible to them. Well, they charge us tariffs. European Union has a VAT tax, which is through the roof, okay? It's a similar thing, similar to a tariff. It's a VAT. And they have it, and it's numbers like you wouldn't believe. And Canada, I told you about the banks, and I told you, they charge us. And people don't say that. They don't like to say it. We'll have, I think, some very fair — all we want is a fair deal.
