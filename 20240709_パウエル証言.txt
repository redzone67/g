Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee Holds Hearing on Semiannual Monetary Policy Report
LIST OF PANEL MEMBERS AND WITNESSES

SHERROD BROWN:
The Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs will come to order. Welcome, Chair Powell. Nice to have you back. Good to have you first this time of year. Ohioans know, Americans know that our economy fundamentally is not a fair playing field. Instead, we have a David and Goliath economy where the largest corporations use their power to funnel all the gains in the economy to the top.

Aided and abetted by too many people in this room, corporations squeeze every last penny from Americans' pocketbooks and workers' paychecks. They don't even try to hide it anymore. The biggest corporations are charging more for less. Americans are frustrated -- no. Actually, Americans are pissed off. They have fewer and fewer choices.

These choices cost more and more. Keeping prices down is part of the Fed's mandate. But as many of us have made clear, the Fed's main tool to combat inflation, raising interest rates, does nothing to address the biggest causes of rising prices, right now corporate greed. Keeping rates too high for too long threatens workers' paychecks while keeping other costs high, particularly housing costs.

Housing prices and rents continue to go up. It's no surprise that, since the Fed began raising rates, the amount of income families need to qualify for a mortgage has nearly doubled. Home ownership has long been a bedrock of our middle class, but today fewer and fewer middle class families can afford to buy a home.

Higher interest rates are making our country's housing supply shortage worse, not better. We need more housing construction of all types. Higher rates lead to the opposite, and particularly make it harder for multifamily construction to work financially. Higher interest rates make borrowing more expensive for working families, whether it's for a mortgage or a car or anything else.

Most people don't have the luxury of paying for everything in cash. And for the millions of Americans feeling their budgets stretched by higher prices, taking on credit card debt to pay for groceries and other essentials has become an option of last resort. But as more people struggle to pay down their debts, credit card interest rates are reaching all time highs.

Last month, Director Chopra testified in front of this committee and explicitly stated that credit card issuers are charging higher rates, far beyond what they need to cover their costs, corporate greed rearing its head again. Banks are making record profits at the expense of cash strapped Americans. Every month that the Fed keeps rates high, Mr. Chair, it costs Americans money by making it more expensive to buy a house and to borrow money.

Higher borrowing costs stifle future economic growth, leading to fewer homes being built, leading to businesses making fewer investments in the economy, and eventually, if the Fed doesn't stop, leading to workers losing their jobs. As they set economic policy, I'd urge the Fed to weigh these trade offs and remember whose jobs and futures are at stake.

It's why I've worked with my colleagues to hold corporations accountable and will continue to do that. For instance, we fought to cap insulin prices for senior citizens. We'll continue to fight to extend this price cap -- this price cap on lifesaving drugs for all Americans, and why my colleagues and I on this committee are working -- it's why we're working to lower housing costs for more Americans.

The Fed also continues its work to keep the banking system stable and ensure consumers' money is safe. Last year, the Fed and other bank regulators issued a proposal to update bank capital requirements, strong capital standards. And you've heard in this committee overwhelming support for strong capital standards.

They're critical from the economy -- for the economy. It's our way of making sure that, if Wall Street's bets -- Wall Street bets go poorly, which they often do, investors, executives and shareholders should pay for it, not taxpayers. The biggest banks have spent -- have spent obscene amounts of money attacking this Fed proposal.

But you, the Fed, don't work for big banks. You work for the American people. Your concern should be developing capital rules that protect Americans' money, not protect bank CEOs' stock portfolios. The Fed needs to look past these shameless lobbying efforts and finalize a rule in the best interest of taxpayers.

Another dangerous piece of the Wall Street business model that makes our banking system less safe is incentive-based compensation. This compensation model rewards risky behavior that enriches Wall Street executives in the short term but banks -- makes banks more likely to fail. We saw the results of that model in 2008. We saw it again last year with the failure of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature.

Other regulators have moved forward with a proposal to rein in these reckless incentives, but the rule, Mr. Chair, can't move forward without your and the Feds moving on it. This rule is long overdue. The Fed must join this statutorily required effort as soon as possible. The Fed also has the important job of reviewing mergers and acquisitions between and among banks.

Over the last several decades, we've seen the largest banks grow into massive literally trillion dollar companies, while thousands of small banks in rural communities in northwest and southeast Ohio, in small towns in those communities -- in those areas and all across America have disappeared. Consumers have lost trusted local banks.

Small businesses have lost long-time reliable banking partners. Regulators like the Fed have the crucial job of guarding against mergers that reduce or eliminate competition and lead to bank closures or layoffs. I recently sent comment letters to the OCC and the FDIC on their current efforts. I expect the Fed to take the proper steps to ensure that its merger review process is robust and that it protects consumers and communities.

Finally, Mr. Chair, you must ensure the Fed has high ethical standards. Fed officials should never again be able to profit from their positions by using confidential plans about Fed monetary policy and emergency programs to pad their investment portfolios. The board's latest update to its trading rules is simply not good enough.

It still fails to establish the clear penalties needed for Federal Reserve officials who make investments in violation -- in violation of the public trust. A rule with no consequences is really not much of a rule at all. The American people need to be able to trust that the Federal Reserve works for them.

In a time of deep cynicism that people have about the federal government overall, the American people need to know that officials aren't abusing their positions for personal gain. As chair, you have an important role to play to make sure our economy works for everyone, not just for Wall Street. The Fed's regional banks must do their part to hear from people and other stakeholders in their 12 districts to understand their needs.

I look forward to hearing today how the Fed will balance its dual mandate, how it will protect Americans' money, how it will foster an economy that upholds the dignity of work. Senator Scott?


TIM SCOTT:
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Chair Powell, for being with us this morning. Welcome -- welcome back. Joe Biden broke this economy, and it's been very difficult to fix it. That's the bottom line. I want to start with the end in mind. Joe Biden broke our economy, and it is very difficult for anyone to fix it. Every day, families are struggling to put food on the table.

Real wage growth is being eaten away by rising prices and runaway inflation. Think about the fact that, for 52 consecutive weeks in the Joe Biden, wages were eclipsed by inflation for 52 consecutive paychecks. I remember back in December of 2020 in South Carolina, gas was $1.99 per gallon. Today it's still $3.19 per gallon, a 50 percent increase in just a few years.

So, it's devastating to the average American family, particularly families like the one I grew up in, a single parent household mired in poverty. When you see your gas price is up 50 percent, your food up 30 percent, your cost of keeping your house cool or warm up 25 percent, it's not a challenge. It's not unfortunate.

It's an absolute crisis. And too many households in America today are living paycheck to paycheck, and they fear the challenges that are coming our way, the headwinds brought to us by the Biden administration. Those headlines -- head -- headwinds, of course, is seen through the prism of inflation. Inflation hasn't been this high since the Jimmy Carter years.

And that devastation is being felt and measured in households by too much month at the end of the money. And that devastation is real for the vast majority of Americans. And the pointing finger, I tell you what, brother, it's the Biden administration throwing the Fed under the bus or any other way they can deflect from the real problem.

I've seen it committee hearing after committee hearing after committee hearing. My friends on the left want to point their fingers at anyone other than the real culprits at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. The progressive wish list, spending projects, and out of control regulations of this administration continues to eat away at America paychecks.

And they continue to blame. Whether it's shrinkflation, greedflation, skimp inflation, they're looking for someone to blame except for Bidenflation. The devastation of Joe Biden's economic policy continues to impact everyday Americans. The American people see through the facades and they want real solutions.

It doesn't take a PhD economist to understand what the average American is experiencing under this administration. When President Biden and my Democratic colleagues pumped trillions of dollars into our economy, those dollars increased the demand and pushes prices higher. It's that simple. The American people see and feel it every single time.

And they see it, as I said earlier, at the grocery stores, the gas stations, at the doctor's office. It's just undeniable, the impact that this is happening. Just last week, we celebrated the birth of our country, the birth of this notion of freedom and liberty. But American families got slapped with the most expensive July 4th on record, with a cookout this year costing on average 30 percent more than it did just a few years ago.


TIM SCOTT:
I call that hogwash. What's worse is that this administration doesn't want to learn a lesson in economics. Instead of reducing the push for more spending and more regulations, they only simply double down. Let's take for example the tens of billions of dollars of student loan forgiveness, constant new plans to forgive more money regardless of the constitutionality of their decisions. So, it's important to ask who are these billions of dollars of forgiveness actually benefiting. Well, the answer's simple. This forgiveness scheme will result in debt relief for 750,000 individuals from households with an average income of $300,000 or more.

And just don't forget the fact that the average American family has a household income around $74,000. So, what we're doing with this unconstitutional student loan forgiveness is actually asking the median household of $74,000 per household -- per -- per household to bear the burden of forgiving debt for students who live in households of over $300,000. And the actual cost of this?

Somewhere between $870 and -- billion and $1.4 trillion. So why have I -- why do I have to even ask the question? Why do we continue to punish American families struggling paycheck to paycheck with a new scheme to relieve households over $300,000 of student loan debt? Well, the answer is pretty simple. Politics.

It's one way to buy vote after vote after vote for November's election. It's just hard to imagine. So, while I appreciate your measured words outlining the Fed's work to cool inflation, I think it's past time we all recognize what is truly going on, political pandering from the left. I strongly believe that our economy cannot handle any more of this wasteful spending.

And if you disagree, I would love to hear your thoughts on that. But it's not just spending policies that stifle growth. It's also overregulation. And I can't think of a better example of overregulation than parking more capital on the sidelines through Basel III endgame. That proposal itself would cost millions of Americans their chance to own a home, start a small business and have access to the credit and the capital necessary to make their American dreams come true.

For those who are actually watching this hearing today on C-Span, Basel III capital requirements are like taking your star quarterback, Dak -- Dak Prescott, and telling him to sit on the sidelines because he just might get injured during the season. It's just plain ridiculous. But these proposed capital requirements would just do that, forcing more money to the sidelines of the greatest economy on the planet and out of the hands of first time homebuyers, business owners and folks trying to achieve the American dream.

The stakes are high, and that is why we have to get this right. You've heard me say this a number of times, but it bears repeating. We need transparency in your rulemaking process, as this abnormal proposal lacks any form of clear justification. Chairman Powell, it is essential that you, your fellow governors and the other agencies joined in this rulemaking follow the law, do the homework and then let the public check the work.

That's why I believe that it is absolutely necessary to put -- to have a complete re-proposal of Basel III endgame. Give the stakeholders an opportunity to take a look at it and then recalibrate what is necessary going forward. Any increases in capital that are not quantitatively justified harm the American people who need it most.

Our farmers, home buyers, small business owners need and deserve access to credit. Therefore, I'll repeat it one more time. You need to restore confidence in this rulemaking process, pull the existing proposal and have a complete restart. And then, when the data has been analyzed and is available for the public's scrutiny, reissue an appropriate proposed rule following the requirements of the APP -- APA. I look forward to your opening statement and having a chance to have the conversation afterwards.


SHERROD BROWN:
Thank you, Senator Scott. Mr. Chair, welcome. Thank you for your service and for your testimony today. Please proceed.


JEROME POWELL:
Chairman Brown, Ranking Member Scott, and other members of the committee, I appreciate the opportunity to present the Federal Reserve's semiannual monetary policy report. The Federal Reserve remains squarely focused on our dual mandate, to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the benefit of the American people.

Over the past two years, the economy has made considerable progress toward the Fed's two percent inflation goal, and labor market conditions have cooled while remaining strong. Reflecting these developments, the risks to achieving our employment and inflation goals are coming into better balance. I will review the current economic situation before turning to monetary policy.

Recent indicators suggest that the US economy continues to expand at a solid pace. Gross domestic product growth appears to have moderated in the first half of this year, following impressive strength in the second half of last year. Private domestic demand remains robust, however with slower but still solid increases in consumer spending.

We have also seen moderate growth in capital spending and a pickup in residential investment so far this year. Improving supply conditions have supported resilient demand and the strong performance of the US economy over the past year. In the labor market, a broad set of indicators suggest that conditions have returned to about where they stood on the eve of the pandemic, strong but not overheated.

The unemployment rate has moved higher, but was still low -- was still at a low level of 4.1 percent in June. Payroll gains averaged 222,000 per month in the first half of the year. Strong job creation over the past couple of years has been accompanied by an increase in the supply of workers, reflecting increases in labor force participation among individuals aged 25 to 54, so-called workers in their prime working years, and a strong pace of immigration.

As a result, the jobs to workers gap is well down from its peak, and now stands just a bit above its 2019 pre-pandemic level. Nominal wage growth has eased over the past year. The strong labor market has helped narrow longstanding disparities in employment and earnings across demographic groups. Inflation has eased notably over the past couple of years, but remains above the Federal Open Market Committee's longer run goal of two percent.

Total personal consumption expenditures prices rose 2.6 percent over the 12 months ending in May. Core PCE prices, which exclude the volatile food and energy categories, also increased 2.6 percent. After a lack of progress toward our two percent inflation objective in the early part of this year, the most recent monthly readings have shown modest further progress.

Longer term inflation expectations appear to remain well anchored, as reflected in a broad range of surveys of households, businesses and forecasters, as well as measures from financial markets. Our monetary policy actions are guided by our dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people.

In support of these goals, the committee has maintained the target range for the federal funds rate at 5.25 to 5.5 percent since last July after having tightened the stance of monetary policy significantly over the previous year and a half. We've also continued to reduce our securities holdings. At our May meeting, we decided to slow the pace of balance sheet runoff starting in June, consistent with the plans released previously.

A restrictive monetary policy stance is helping to bring demand and supply conditions into better balance and to put downward pressure on inflation. The committee has stated that we do not expect it will be appropriate to reduce the target range for the federal funds rate until we have gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward two percent.

Incoming data for the first quarter of this year did not support such greater confidence. The most recent inflation readings, however, have shown some modest further progress, and more good data would strengthen our confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward two percent. We continue to make decisions meeting by meeting.

We know that reducing policy restraint too soon or too much could stall or even reverse the progress that we've seen on inflation. At the same time, in light of the progress we've made both in lowering inflation and in cooling the labor market over the past two years, elevated inflation is not the only risk we face.

Reducing policy restraint too late or too little could unduly weaken economic activity and employment. In considering adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the committee will continue its practice of carefully assessing incoming data and their implications for the evolving outlook, the balance of risks and the appropriate path of monetary policy.

Congress has entrusted the Federal Reserve with operational independence that is needed to take a longer term perspective in the pursuit of our dual mandate of maximum employment and stable prices. We remain committed to bringing inflation back down to our two percent goal and to keeping longer term inflation expectations well anchored.

Restoring price stability is essential to achieving maximum employment and stable prices over the long run. Our success in delivering on those goals matters to all Americans. I'll conclude by emphasizing that we understand that our actions affect communities, families and businesses across the country. Everything we do is in service to our public mission.

Thank you. I'll look forward to your questions.


SHERROD BROWN:
Thank you, Mr. Chair. And the senior member of the committee will begin the questioning, Senator Reed.


JACK REED:
Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Former President Trump has indicated that he would propose, if elected, a substantial increase in tariffs of between 10 and 60 percent, and by doing thus eliminate the federal income tax. First, on -- the question of what would be the impact of tariff increases on prices, consumers and the economy?


JEROME POWELL:
Thank you, Senator Reed. I -- I -- so I'm going to say that we go very far out of our way not to comment on campaign type information. We just -- we just don't do that. We also don't comment on trade policy. We have really specific and important jobs, and we try to stick to those.


JACK REED:
Well, I'm glad I allowed you to establish that principle up front, Mr. Chairman. But let me opine a bit. 10 percent increases in tariffs is going to have an effect on prices in the shop aisle. It's going to increase them because it'll be passed on, likely. 60 percent tariff increases are significant. And in fact, I've been told that, to replace the income tax, you would have to raise tariffs across the board 70 percent to make up for the loss of the income tax, which would, I think, create huge economic problems.

I respect your impartiality and your neutrality, but the numbers don't seem to add up to anything that would help the country. Let me switch to something else that might be more within your line of response. You said in your opening statement that labor markets appear to be in a better balance, and that's one of the key factors to judge whether interest rates can be raised.

I must say I'm concerned a bit that we -- we're not on a very faster track to decreasing interest rates at the -- from the Fed, and because of the -- the better balance you cite. Can you comment on that, Mr. Chairman?


JEROME POWELL:
Sure. So, the most recent labor market data do send, to your point, a pretty clear signal that labor market conditions have cooled considerably compared to where they were two years ago. This is no longer an overheated economy. This is an economy, as I mentioned in my opening remarks, that is more or less back, by most measures, to where it was before the pandemic.

And that was a strong labor market, but it was not an overheated labor market. So, I -- I think the -- the upshot of that really is that we are -- we're well aware that we now face two-sided risks, and have for some time. But now, you know, the labor market appears to be fully back in balance. We know that if we move too quickly, we risk -- we risk, you know, unnecessarily hampering economic activity and possibly interfering with the ongoing expansion.

We know that if we move too slowly, that we may undo the good we've done -- well, actually it's the other way. If we -- if we -- if we loosen policy too late or too little, we could -- we could hurt economic activity. If we loosen policy too much or too soon, then we could undermine the progress on inflation.

So, we're very much balancing those two risks. And that -- that's really the -- the essence of what we're thinking about these days.


JACK REED:
But the direction seems to be going towards lowering interest rates at some point, we would hope. That might be a wish rather than a -- it's -- than a direction.


JEROME POWELL:
Well, I think if you look at the -- the last summary of economic projections -- I guess I would say it this way. The -- it doesn't seem likely that the next policy move would be a rate increase. We don't take things like that off the table, but that does not seem the -- the likely direction. The likely direction does seem to be in, as we make more progress in inflation and as the labor market remains strong, we begin to loosen policy at the right moment.


JACK REED:
Thank you. Just two weeks ago, the Supreme Court handed down two decisions that impact every federal regulatory agency, including the Federal Reserve. They overturned the Chevron case, which had eliminated judicial deference to agency decision making for many, many decades. And they also dramatically extended the statute of limitations under the Administrative Procedure Act. What is your judgment -- is the cumulative effect of these decisions on the Federal Reserve?

More broadly, what does it mean to the economy if virtually any regulatory decision the Fed makes can be second guessed by a judge? What position are you in now?


JEROME POWELL:
So we're, as an institution, very focused on reading the actual letter and intent of the law and following it carefully. This is a strong institutional value that we have. Those are brand new decisions that just came down and we're really in the process of just studying some. I don't have anything for you on them, but we will of course follow the law as the Supreme Court has read it because that's their job.


JACK REED:
Well, thank you and I concur with compliance with the law. But when you do your analysis and if it is detrimental to your ability to regulate the banking industry in the United States, I think you have an obligation to make that public. Thank you, Mr. Chair.


SHERROD BROWN:
Thank you, Senator Reed. Senator Scott from South Carolina is recognized.


TIM SCOTT:
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chair Powell, we've heard a steady stream of commentary that there will be changes to Basel three endgame proposal that can be seen certainly as good news. Some reports say it could be finalized as soon as August. Others say you are circulating a term sheet for a revised proposal.

Through it all, this proposal will have outsized impacts on our banking system from big to regional to our US based foreign institutions as well as impeding access to credit for consumers. So even though you yourself have said there will be broad and material changes, I believe this proposal is flawed, both in process and in substance, and should be withdrawn.

Do you agree? And will you commit to withdrawing the existing proposal and issuing a new proposal with a robust notice and comment process?


JEROME POWELL:
Well, let me update everyone on the status of all that.


TIM SCOTT:
Please.


JEROME POWELL:
So over the past several months, we've had, in fact, Vice Chair for Supervision Barr has held a series of discussions with the other bank regulatory agencies around potential changes to the original proposal. I'm pleased to say that we've made quite a bit of progress on those and are very close to agreeing on the substance of those changes.

And I can't really be specific because nothing is agreed until everything is agreed, so I won't have a lot of specifics for you today. The question where we're continuing to try to make progress is that of process. So it is my view, it is the strongly held view of members of the board, that we do need to put a revised proposal out for comment for some period.

And the reason is, when there are broad and material changes, that has been our practice. We don't see a reason to deviate from that practice. It seems to be consistent with past practice and with the Administrative Procedure Act. So that's very much what we think and we're working through that question with the FDIC and the OCC. We haven't reached agreement on that, but I'm very hopeful that we will.

We're prepared to move forward at that when we do reach agreement on that.


TIM SCOTT:
OK. Well, I appreciate most of your response there. I do want to discuss one aspect more of Basel before we move on to another topic. I find it very concerning with how much of this proposal, this process appears to have been done behind closed doors. The Fed, the FDIC, OCC, proposed Basel three endgame last July.

Then in October, the Fed began the collection of data to conduct a quantitative impact study on the Cost of Basel three proposal, a study which I will note should have been conducted before any proposal was ever issued. Move forward to January of this year, Vice Chair Barr, committed to a public comment period once results of the study were published.

We are still waiting to view the results. Keep in mind, all the while we're hearing rumors that the Fed is working on revising its proposal and moving towards an updated version. Please help me understand how will the Fed revise or reissue a capital proposal before receiving public comments, is basically my question?


JEROME POWELL:
As you know, we have received extensive public comments and we've also evaluated the quantitative impact survey that you mentioned. And so the idea would be when we do reach agreement with the other agencies fully that we would publish the proposed changes and also the quantitative impact survey and also the effects that the QIS suggests, the changes would have.

So we'll put all that out for comment again for a period of time and then having had yet another round of comment, we can then move toward finalizing that. That's basically the broad strokes of how I would see this moving forward.


TIM SCOTT:
And how long do you see that opportunity for public comments?


JEROME POWELL:
So it would be meaningful. I mean, it might be 60 days. It doesn't need to be a long one. But before we do that, there's a lot of work that needs to take place before you actually put out the revised proposal, quite a bit of work, so it will take some time. And then we would put it out and then there would be let's -- I mean, I'm just taking that number 60 days of comment and then we would get the comments back and it would be another period of evaluating the comments.

And only then would you go final, so there are a number of steps here.


TIM SCOTT:
Yeah. Thank you. Well, just a final point, as I'm running out of time here. Senator Reed made the comment about the Chevron case and the impact that it could have, certainly in curtailing, from my perspective, the regulatory state. The necessity of a cost benefit analysis on new regulations that will impact the economy I think is quite helpful.

And the thousands, thousand plus pages of Basel three, I think there were about 20 pages that reflected some kind of cost benefit analysis approach. I really hope that we see more of that going forward.


JEROME POWELL:
Thank you.


SHERROD BROWN:
Senator Tester from Montana is recognized.


JON TESTER:
Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you for the courtesy, Chairman Powell. Good to see you here today. Appreciate your work. Look, regardless of where I go in the state of Montana, housing is a big issue, whether it's Billings or Butte or Bozeman or Busby or Big Sandy, it doesn't matter. Larger towns, the medium sized towns, the small towns.

Housing is a huge issue and I think it's a huge issue all over the country and correct me if I'm not correct in that. And I was wondering how the housing challenges fit into the overall economic picture that you're seeing?


JEROME POWELL:
So we do pay a lot of attention and I would agree with you, we have significant housing issues in the country, and we had them before the pandemic. Certainly, the pandemic has created new distortions and monetary policy works through interest sensitive spending. There is no more interest sensitive spending than you know buying a house and having a mortgage.

So for sure, our tighter policy is having an effect on economic activity in the housing sector, but I would also say the best thing we can do for housing is to succeed in getting inflation down to two percent on a sustainable basis, so that rates can come down so that the housing market can get back to what was the pre-pandemic normal, which is to say still a housing shortage, but not dealing with the kinds of specific things we're dealing with now.


JON TESTER:
So let me drill down a little bit. I'm speaking not necessarily from a housing cost interest, and you're correct on the things you just brought up. I'm speaking more from a standpoint of economic growth and that there are plenty of small businesses, schools, hospitals, Main Street businesses that can't hire people.

They can't expand because there simply is no place for them to live. How does that fit into your economic outlook metrics? Because I think it's, from my perspective at least, I think it's limiting the opportunity for expansion. It's limiting the opportunity for entrepreneurs, business startups and does that fit into the economic picture that you look at?


JEROME POWELL:
So our mandate is for stable prices and maximum employment. And again, I think for housing supply, the best thing we can do is get inflation under control so that rates can come back down, so that we can have a more normalized set of rates and a more normalized housing system. But I think policies to increase housing supply are really not so much in the hands of the Fed.

They're in the hands of legislatures, state and federal.


JON TESTER:
So do you believe that if we were to put forth some housing incentives, whatever they may be, that could have a -- if it resulted, if those incentives resulted in more affordable workforce housing on the market, that would have positive impacts on the economy?


JEROME POWELL:
These are questions for you, but I would say this, that I'm aware that housing is in short supply and that for many, it's a critical need for the workforce and so more of it is better. But as to where the fiscal policy, how you should prioritize that, that's not up to us.


JON TESTER:
Look, I want to talk about the independence of the Fed for a second because I know that you are a strong supporter of independence, as am I. And political influence, I don't think, helps with monetary policy in the country. And so give me your perspective at least on why the central bank independence is so critically important.


JEROME POWELL:
Thank you. I'd be glad to. So essentially all advanced economies have adopted a policy of central bank banking, operational independence and that just means that we make our decisions. We're instructed to make them without taking in extraneous factors, one of which would be politics and the record is pretty clear that it's a good institutional arrangement that serves the public well.

And we just want to stress, as we do periodically, that this is an institutional choice that we make as a country and that as long as it's seen to serve the public well, it's a good choice, we think so.


JON TESTER:
OK. On advanced economies, there's some that talk about the economy of this country not being in very good shape. From your perspective, tell me how the economy of this country is doing compared to other advanced economies that have central banks.


JEROME POWELL:
So I'm in lots and lots of international discussions as part of my job and the story for the last two years has been just how exceptional the performance of the US economy has been, and that's not a secret. Clearly, the US economy has performed very well compared to sort of our advanced economy colleagues.


JON TESTER:
Is there any country in the world, a central bank, any advanced economy that's performing better?


JEROME POWELL:
Better as a central bank?


JON TESTER:
No, any economy that's an advanced economy, that has a central bank that performs better than us.


JEROME POWELL:
None comes to mind. As I think of the majors, the answer would be no.


JON TESTER:
OK. Thank you.


SHERROD BROWN:
Thanks, Senator Tester. Senator Rounds of South Dakota is recognized.


MIKE ROUNDS:
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Chairman, first of all, thanks for coming in again and visiting with us. I just want to focus on two specific items and I'm going to start with the Basel three endgame discussion. I think Senator Scott did an excellent job of kind of laying out the concerns that many of us have had with it. I would like to go back into just one particular issue, which I think a lot of folks out there that follow this.

And I know it's technical in nature but let me just ask a specific question and you can kind of pick it apart for me, please. Both you and Vice Chair Barr have confirmed that there will be material changes to every risk type outlined in the proposal. Since there will be significant changes, do you believe where the agencies have landed now would be considered a logical outgrowth of the original proposal from last summer?


JEROME POWELL:
For those people who are not familiar with, that's the legal test that turns out to be if it's a logical outgrowth. If it's not a logical outgrowth, that would require, legally require reproposal. And I don't want to make the legal judgment. I will just say again from my standpoint, my view and strongly held view of some of my colleagues on the board, is that it will be appropriate for us to put out the changes again for a period of comment just because it's the right thing to do. It's what we would do typically in a situation where there are material changes to a proposed rule.


MIKE ROUNDS:
Do you feel that you have a consensus in the board to allow that to move forward in terms of an additional comment period?


JEROME POWELL:
Yes, but of course we have to get the -- the FDIC and the OCC, we're in discussions with them to work to work on something that would meet that need and we have to get their agreement to.


MIKE ROUNDS:
Assuming, it sounds like that's the path that you would like to go down.


JEROME POWELL:
Yes.


MIKE ROUNDS:
If that were the case, would it be fair to say that we'd probably be looking at final determinations or recommendations for a Basel three endgame proposal probably into next year before it would become anything of a final determination?


JEROME POWELL:
I think that that may be right. Something like that could be right. Yeah. I mean, it's hard to be precise. We would put it out. It takes some time to write this stuff up. Then you put it out for comment, then you get the comments, then you read the comments, then you write the final rule. Beginning part of next year is a good guesstimate.


MIKE ROUNDS:
The only reason why I push is because there are so many folks directly involved with this and the impact on our economy here and with a lot of our financial institutions, this is a significant change and it's one that a lot of people are following. So I'm trying to get you to get into the depth of this as much as possible, and I thank you for that.

I also want to go into one other area. And once again, this is something that you and I have had visits about in front of this group before. But I want to talk about what the parts of inflation are and what parts you can control and what parts, as the Fed, you really can't control. The demand side of the equation on inflation is the part that you have the tools to work with, but there is the supply side of the equation which is still out there.



MIKE ROUNDS:
And I want to just lay this out, because as we do this in this setting, it naturally becomes political in nature because one of the starting points that we talk about is when this administration took office and what happens with supply side issues at that time. And as I work my way through this, I just want to share the concern that I've got. And then I recognize you don't want to be political in it, but I want to lay this out and then I want to talk about what you can control and what you can't control with regard to making changes on inflation through the processes that you have.

When President Biden took office gasoline prices -- since President Biden took office, gasoline prices have risen over 54 percent. Energy prices have risen 41 percent. Fuel oil prices have risen 37 percent. Now, I can go on and on, but you understand what I'm saying is, is that energy has increased substantially.

And I think one of the reasons for, this has been additional demand as we've come out of a pandemic, but the other part of this has been whether or not investors really want to go back in and invest in traditional energy resources after the president made this specific determination to cancel the Keystone XL pipeline on the day that he stepped into office.

When he did that, he sent one heck of a message to investors about traditional energy and investing in traditional energy in the United States, and the fact that a multibillion dollar contract could be canceled with the stroke of a pen. Now my question to you is what percent, or has there been a discussion about what percent or what amount of the inflation that we've seen over 20 percent increase in terms of affordability for a lot of our products, how much of that is attributable to the demand side and how much of it really is attributable to supply side challenges that we've seen in this country?


JEROME POWELL:
That's a question that we've thought about a lot and any attempt to reduce that to a precise number would be inappropriate because it's so uncertain. But I think we can say, I believe strongly, there's a significant demand element and there's a significant supply element and we've seen the supply side heal so much over the course of the last year or so. And we clearly see that that's contributing to lower inflation.

We also see cooling demand, for example, in the labor market. So the two forces are working together. I can't really break it down. It would be such an imprecise estimate. I couldn't say.


MIKE ROUNDS:
Just simply an acknowledgment though that it is both, demand and it is supply. It's both. It's definitely both. It is both, yeah. For sure. Thank you. Thank Mr. Chairman. My time has expired.


SHERROD BROWN:
Thank you, Senator Rounds. Chair Powell, unemployment has risen by a half percentage point over the past year. The number of job openings has dropped almost 50 percent. The hiring and quit rates are now below pre-pandemic levels. I'm concerned that if the Fed waits too long to lower rates, the Fed could undo the progress we've made on creating good paying jobs.

Full employment is part of the mandate, as you say over and over. How are you assessing the risks of higher interest rates in the labor market?


JEROME POWELL:
So I completely agree with your characterization that the latest data do show that we've had considerable cooling in the labor market, and we do -- we're very much aware that we have two sided risks now, as I mentioned earlier, and we're determined to balance those as best we can. We want to see more good inflation data and we also want to continue to see a strong labor market.

And those two things are equal under the law. We have this challenging thing to balance them, but we're very much conscious that that is our job and we're trying to do that.


SHERROD BROWN:
Well, and you know that if unemployment trends upward, you must act immediately to protect Americans' jobs. Workers have too much to lose if the Fed overshoots inflation target and causes a completely unnecessary recession. We will say that over and over and over again. I think you understand that. Housing.

Higher interest rates are making housing more unaffordable. Higher rates are supposed to lower costs, yet housing prices to continue to soar. By keeping rates high, the Fed ignores the economic reality of the millions of Americans struggling to make ends meet and get ahead. Let me ask you three quick yes or no questions if you would answer that way.

Since late 2022, when the Fed began raising rates, has the volume of housing sales decreased?


JEROME POWELL:
I believe it has, yes.


SHERROD BROWN:
Since late 2022, has the median home price increased?


JEROME POWELL:
I believe it has.


SHERROD BROWN:
Since late 2022, have monthly mortgage payments become more affordable or less affordable for home buyers?


JEROME POWELL:
Less affordable.


SHERROD BROWN:
OK. Thank you. In short, despite housing sales declining, the median price for a single home, single family home has increased by nearly $20,000. People are spending a greater share of their income in mortgage payments. So in some higher rates, it's clear from your answers and data, it's clear higher rates are not bringing down housing costs.

The cost of homeownership is going only going up. Let me shift to this Synapse bankruptcy. Since mid-May, tens of thousands of people, including many Ohioans have lost access to their money due to the bankruptcy of this fintech middleman. Reports indicate that as much as $95 million may have gone missing.

The Fed oversees one of Synapse's former partner banks, Evolve Bank, and trust as a regulator, it's your job to make sure that banks protect the people whom they serve. What's the Fed doing to help customers who felt the impact by the Synapse collapse? What are you doing to regain access to their money?


JEROME POWELL:
So we do supervise the bank. We don't supervise Synapse or let alone the fintechs that feed into Synapse and we're strongly encouraging Evolve to do whatever it can to help make money available to those depositors. We also, as you may know, did an enforcement action against -- before this all happened, we did an inspection or looked at Evolve and we hit them with an enforcement action around these very risk management issues, again, before the current situation developed.


SHERROD BROWN:
OK. It's critical that consumers are made whole as soon as possible. We will continue to talk to you about that. We will watch, we will let you know we're watching. The Fed needs to use its supervisory authority to ensure that Evolve is committing the resources necessary to return those funds to the account holders.

Last comment, I want to note one last thing. Last year's Fed report on the failure of Silicon Valley Bank noted how incentive based compensation encouraged excessive risk taking that led to the bank's failure. You either watched or had reports of when those bank CEOs testified in front of this committee.

The report, the incentive based compensation that led to the bank's failure, I mentioned, it said that SVB managers quote had a financial incentive to focus on short-term profit over sound risk management. That's what a number of us, Senator Smith, Senator Butler, Senator Warner and I have said over and over, that the short-term profit over sound risk management causes significant problems to our financial system.

Compensation practices still pose a threat to our banking system. I urge you to move quickly to join your colleagues in the long overdue rulemaking on executive compensation. I mean, you know, you read the reports at the outrage of the public about executive compensation continuing to go up and up and up and up. You have a role, a significant role, a legal role to deal with that.

Thank you. Senator Tillis is recognized.


THOM TILLIS:
Thank you, Mr. Chair. Chairman, thank you for being here. I want to be real quick on Basel III endgame and I want to be mindful of time. Just simply, can I get a commitment from you on releasing the results of the QIS?


JEROME POWELL:
Yeah. We plan to release the results of the QIS, not just --


THOM TILLIS:
What timeframe?


JEROME POWELL:
Well, first, we have to get agreement with the other banking agencies, but as soon as possible.


THOM TILLIS:
Can you imagine any agencies having a concern with -- any other banking agencies having a concern with releasing it or is it just a matter of proforma?


JEROME POWELL:
Not at all. No, it's just a matter of the bigger picture of getting agreement on the revisions to Basel III and also how to proceed.


THOM TILLIS:
That's great. And I really appreciate the feedback that I've received from you. I should have started by thanking you again for your continued accessibility and discussions outside of the committee. They're very productive and I appreciate that. And your leadership at the Fed. I grew up in the 70s, got my Social Security number in 1973 when I was 12 years old.

That's when I made my first payment. So I've been following the economy even as a youngster, and that was a really lousy time to enter in the workforce. Tell me, and I'm hearing discussions among some of our members now, that would almost be reminiscent of discussions with prior Fed members saying, look, we got to lower interest rates and we've got unemployment out of control.

So it sounds like we're taking some suggestions from some of my colleagues or plays from a playbook that didn't prove to be very effective back in the 70s. What can we learn -- what would -- I'm not going to ask you about where you go from here, but if we look back into a postmortem on some of the decisions that were made when we had consistently high un-inflation, we had the -- inflation, I should say.

We had consistently high unemployment. What lessons can we learn there or what mistakes should we not necessarily repeat? And I know every -- that this is a fingerprint of a challenge. It's not exactly like the stressors that we had back in the 70s, but what can we learn from the decisions, of what I think are arguably the wrong decisions made back then when we were dealing with high unemployment and high inflation?

What have we learned?


JEROME POWELL:
I think the number one thing we learned was that it's up to the central bank to take it on and stick with it until it's done. And that doesn't sound controversial now, but it actually was back then. And so people didn't really get in there and get it done and inflation kept coming back. I also think there are significant differences this time to the questions a minute ago.

This is a combination of a of a supply side that we had very significant supply shocks along with big demand shocks from the reopening of the economy and from all the other things that happened. So I think we have to -- each one of these things is different in its own way. We try to learn the lessons of history though.


THOM TILLIS:
Do you agree or disagree, any disconnect between inflation and inflation expectations from the two percent target should be addressed now and not at a later time?


JEROME POWELL:
Absolutely.


THOM TILLIS:
I like that answer. I want to go to something different. I'm trying to go into a lightning round now and finish on time. We've seen the 2024 stress test results for the banking, US banking system. It looks like to me by every objective measure, we've got a banking system that's on strong financial footing.

Do you agree?


JEROME POWELL:
Yes.


THOM TILLIS:
One last thing is the Fed considers making broad and material changes to the Basel III proposal, back on that one, can I urge you not to overlook the second order issues important to FBOs and certain regionals to ensure the bank that banks are not unduly influenced? The current proposal, for example, the outsized operational risk costs were high.

Are we going to take care of that in any sort of reproposal?


JEROME POWELL:
Let me just say, we're very conscious of the comments across the spectrum, foreign banks, domestic banks, small, medium sized banks. Everyone's going to get heard carefully as part of this process. That is our obligation.


THOM TILLIS:
And I think in response to Senator Rounds question, you did indicate there's probably because of the nature of the likely changes from what Mr. Barr expected to what may ultimately come, we are going to open it up to comment again?


JEROME POWELL:
That's the strong view of the Federal Reserve. We're working on that question with the FDIC and the OCC to try to find a path to do that. But from our standpoint, that's essential.


THOM TILLIS:
Very good. I think it's a strong view from at least several members on this side of the dais here. That would be very, very, important because I think it's going to materially change. Thank you. Mr. Chair.


SHERROD BROWN:
Thank you, Senator Tillis. Senator Warner of Virginia is recognized.


MARK WARNER:
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Powell, it's good to see you again. Coming this late in the questioning, I'm going to at least hit a couple of the items that my colleagues have otherwise already hit because I'll make sure it's noted that I raised them as well. I, first of all, want to agree with the chairman.

I probably hear more on housing and housing affordability than any other issue and I agree with the chairman, and I know we've discussed this around a rate cut and I understand most of your answer, but I still want to add my $0.02 here. We've got to find a way to start bringing mortgage rates down and let people unlock that housing market.

And again, we've discussed the rate cut issue and I know you've got to navigate that, but I hope it's sooner than later. I will not recap what I've done in the last couple hearings with you, but I do think the discount window proposal that I've gotten, that I know you're working on, before we think about additional regulations and we do need in some cases, I think the discount window is an underused tool, was one of the initial, original tools for the Fed.

A lot of my colleagues have talked about quantitative easing, or I mean Basel III endgame. I do hope when we get the revisions that we'll see the quantitative analysis, that again Senator Tillis already raised and other colleagues have raised. I also hope that one of the questions I raised in my March letter to you was making sure any new regulatory structure, how it intersects with existing regulatory structure, in terms of market risk, credit risk, and I again hope that we will have that as the revisions come out.

I think one of the things that this debate around Basel III raised was, that it is my understanding at least, looked at you may be all looking at revisions to liquidity standards as well. And wanted to see what you could say about that and whether that part of those standards are under review and what your thinking is. And I think.


JEROME POWELL:
Yeah. And I think that actually connects to the Silicon Valley bank questions as well where I think there seems to be a need to update assumptions about liquidity and that's a separate proposal that we're also working on. And very important. I think we saw how fast that run was. It was just exponentially faster than prior runs.

That's the new world and that's some estimate of what that world is, is baked into things like the liquidity coverage ratio for example.


MARK WARNER:
Right. And wasn't that the case? If you had $0.25 on every depository dollar leave in six hours, no matter what the capital standards are.


JEROME POWELL:
Yeah.


MARK WARNER:
And one of the things, I guess, there was a lot of talk after SVB that we need to think about internet driven runs. A lot of us raised concerns. Candidly, I'm not sure I've heard any good proposals. So whether it comes from you guys or from folks listening, how we think about this new internet driven world.

And frankly, I think some of the irresponsible behavior by some of the folks that were major depositors in SVB, who in many ways shouted fire in the crowded theater and we've not seen any action there. So I would welcome additional ideas as well and that kind of brings me to my last questions around supervisory reform.

I know the GAO criticized the Fed's supervisory procedures in the role they played in the 2023 failures. It is a whole brand new world. Are we going to look at -- will your changes to supervisory standards be comprehensive? Will they be one off? How do you think about that in light of the GAO report? And also in light of just the SVB and the few of the other failures we saw last year?


JEROME POWELL:
Vice Chair Barr is vice chair for supervision, is leading a process of looking at the way we supervise banks and thinking about how we can be faster, where it's appropriate, more forceful where it's appropriate. And I think you know if they've taken a pretty deep dive and tried to learn these lessons and then implement them in a way that is appropriate.

So that's a big project going on at the Fed right now, which really vice chair for supervision leads.


MARK WARNER:
I think, I remember lots of conversations with the chairman, with you, with the FDIC and that Thursday through Sunday. And I think the solution you guys came up with, the administration came up with by Sunday night was a good one. But they were pretty scary three or four days there and it did seem like the process, I don't know completely how you get fully ahead of that, but I firmly believe that there should have been a clearer early warning system and trying to make sure that we wouldn't be in that kind of crisis situation going forward.

And again, I would strongly encourage any additional thoughts on this technology risk and how we get that right. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Chairman.


SHERROD BROWN:
Thank you, Senator Warner. Senator Kennedy of Louisiana is recognized.


JOHN KENNEDY:
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Chairman, our economy is slowing, is it not?


JEROME POWELL:
Yes, although still growing at a solid pace.


JOHN KENNEDY:
Our unemployment rate is rising, is it not?


JEROME POWELL:
Yes, it is, although the labor market is still strong.


JOHN KENNEDY:
Our labor market is slowing, is it not?


JEROME POWELL:
Yes, but I'd say unemployment is still low by historical standards, but yes, it is. We've seen cooling, yes.


JOHN KENNEDY:
And I was looking at the recent jobs' numbers. I know you've glanced at them too. About three quarters of the net new jobs that were created in June were in government, health care and social assistance. What does that tell you?


JEROME POWELL:
So that's a concentration. You'd rather see broader job creation than that. Those three areas have, in some reports, they've been, as it was this time, they've been the predominant creators of jobs. That tells you that job creation is becoming less broad in the economy and it's narrowing.


JOHN KENNEDY:
It tells you that government's creating those jobs, doesn't it?


JEROME POWELL:
Well, it's government. It's also in-person services. Some of its government.


JOHN KENNEDY:
Manufacturing has been flat.


JEROME POWELL:
Yes, manufacturing is not creating a lot of new jobs these days.


JOHN KENNEDY:
Information technology shed jobs over the past two years, hasn't it?


JEROME POWELL:
I don't know.


JOHN KENNEDY:
Leisure and hospitality jobs have slowed to almost a trickle.


JEROME POWELL:
That's a place where there were there was a desperate worker shortage and they've done quite a bit of hiring, but they're catching up now.


JOHN KENNEDY:
I mean, three quarters of the jobs that are being created in our economy can be related directly or indirectly to our spending deficits, can't they?


JEROME POWELL:
In this report, in this single report, I don't know that health care is really a government spending. That's something people are consuming.


JOHN KENNEDY:
Where do you think these hospitals get their money?


JEROME POWELL:
They may get it, but I mean people are not -- the spending on health care is not necessarily directly related to deficits, is my point.


JOHN KENNEDY:
I would disagree with you. I mean, here's my point. We talk a lot about expectations in terms of inflation, how we expect there to be inflation, we'll get inflation. It seems to me that consumer expectations play a role, a bigger role in the economy than we cede to them. Most of our economy in America is consumer driven, is it not?


JEROME POWELL:
Yes.


JOHN KENNEDY:
Unlike, say, China, which is manufacturing driven.


JEROME POWELL:
Very much so.


JOHN KENNEDY:
And I listened to you cite the statistics about the economy, but most Americans don't feel good about the economy, do they?


JEROME POWELL:
No, and we don't tell people how to feel about the economy.


JOHN KENNEDY:
I mean, isn't it a fact that most people, if you ask them to define Bidenomics, they would say, that's easy, we get to pay more to live worse?


JEROME POWELL:
I wouldn't touch a --


JOHN KENNEDY:
You don't want to answer that one?


JEROME POWELL:
A sentence with that word in it.


JOHN KENNEDY:
Yeah. Yeah. I mean we can pretty this up all we -- I guess my point is, and I know you're going to do this anyway, but I'd be really careful with this economy. I mean, people just don't feel better off today. And one can marshal a persuasive argument that, well, you should, compared to Europe or compared to China, compared to Canada.

But they -- feelings are feelings. People don't feel good about this economy and it's primarily because of inflation. Let me use my final 30 seconds to ask you. I listen to my good friend, the chairman, give his opening statement. Do you think inflation was caused by corporate greed?


JEROME POWELL:
I hate to comment on something the chairman was speaking about.


JOHN KENNEDY:
Go ahead.


JEROME POWELL:
Well, so I will just say we see, at the Fed, we see inflation as when there's an imbalance between supply and demand and we use our tools to work on the demand side of that and bring it back into line with supply.


JOHN KENNEDY:
I got two seconds. So when are you going to lower interest rates?


JEROME POWELL:
I'm, today, not going to be sending any signals about the timing of any future actions.


JOHN KENNEDY:
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.


SHERROD BROWN:
Senator Smith of Minnesota is recognized. Thank you. Mr. Chair.


TINA SMITH:
Thank you, Mr. Chair. Welcome, Chair Powell. It's good to see you again. I want to follow up on kind of the line of questioning that Senator Tester was on a bit ago. He was talking about how the US economy has been outperforming other advanced economies around the world in terms of growth rates, in terms of unemployment, in terms of inflation, getting inflation under control, though I think we obviously can all agree that we're not, at least from my perspective, we're not done yet and we don't want to rest on our laurels.

But I'm wondering if you could share what you think that we have learned from this experience. What have we done right? And why is it that we are doing better than some of the other advanced economies in the world?


JEROME POWELL:
I think that it's down to the fundamental strengths of our economy. So as you may know, European economic officials are very, very focused on this question. They really -- it comes up in all of our discussions. Europe has seen productivity increases of about one percent a year for 40 years. We've seen two percent.

If you take a number and compound it at one percent, then compound it at two percent, the difference is just enormous after 40 years in terms of incomes and living standards. And their question is why is that? Why is that? And the standard answer that Americans tend to give and that I would give is it's down to more flexible labor markets.

In the pandemic, people, they stayed in their existing jobs. The United States, we had people changing jobs at record levels and you know that's the kind of thing that adds to productivity and contributes to rising living standards, going back to school, getting skills and things like that. Another one is our financial sector.

We don't just have banks, we have a highly developed ecosystem of financing sources that will fund early stage investments. Banks are really not set up to do that. They're prudentially regulated and so those are some of the things. I think we just have these natural strengths as an innovative, more flexible economy we can grow faster.


TINA SMITH:
I appreciate that. I think sometimes there's a tendency to sort of trash our economy and to sort of say, oh, we suck. And actually, I think that there's a great resilience in our economy. I would argue that it has also to do a lot with the incredible resilience of our workers and their creativity and their talent and the training and the education that they have.

And I think I would also argue, though I wouldn't expect you to make this case, that the way in which our federal government responded to the pandemic in order to make sure that people weren't evicted, that they had -- they still had money to pay their bills, even when they weren't able to work, meant that overall, our economy survived in a and was ready to kind of be off to the races when we emerged from the pandemic.

But Chair Powell, I'd like to ask you a question, something that you and I have talked about, I continue to be thinking a lot about, which is the commercial real estate risk that we have in this country. I think particularly for office space, we know that that has been under strain the last several years.

The sector has remained largely stable, but we are hearing about some additional default risk. And one thing that I'm noting is that there's some expectation or concern that that may fall disproportionately on smaller banks. I think that commercial and regional banks hold an estimated two thirds of all the commercial real estate loans in the country.

And so unlike larger banks, these smaller institutions might find it a little harder to deal with this. So could you discuss this with us? Could you tell us a little bit about how you see this risk and particularly whether this poses some additional risk that we might be seeing more concentration in the banking sector as these smaller banks are maybe under more pressure?


JEROME POWELL:
Yes. So this, to your point, this is a risk that has been with us and will be with us for some time, probably for years. And banks need to be honestly assessing what their risk is and they need to be assured that they have the capital and liquidity and the systems in place to manage this risk. The stress test that we apply to the largest institutions stressed commercial real estate pretty hard.

And again, the conclusion is that the large banks can manage this problem. And most small banks can too, but it is in some smaller banks that tend to have that local concentration in commercial real estate. And we're in touch with those banks. The supervisors and regulators are in touch with those banks and making sure that they can manage them.

And it's going to be an issue for many banks. But it's one that we're trying to work through, one that we're very much aware of and again, it'll be with us for some time.


TINA SMITH:
Thank you. I think so much about the importance of these small regional community banks in small towns, in big towns in Minnesota and how important it is that, in my book, that they can stay independent and better serve their communities in that way. So I worry about this risk. Thank you, Mr. Chair.


SHERROD BROWN:
Thank you, Senator Smith. Senator Butler of California is recognized.


LAPHONZA BUTLER:
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman, good to see you.


JEROME POWELL:
Good to see you.


LAPHONZA BUTLER:
And I am going to make you do the whole last five minutes since I'm the last one for today. You'll recall the first time that we spoke, I tried to engage you around three specific areas. One was the how the monetary policy impacts the quality of life for young Americans in the future and the work that you are doing there.

The space of climate risk and what I see as potentially a future challenge down the road and that is the state of commercial real estate. You and I have had that conversation before and no surprises today, I'm going to stick to those three topics, somewhat related to questions that you've been asked before relative to the housing market, housing affordability and interest rates.

I want to narrow the scope just a little bit to ask about how those issues and challenges impact, again, the quality of life for America's next generation. Given a severe shortage of affordable and available homes to buy, coupled with high interest rates, young Americans are continually unable to afford homes and are pushed into a rental market, driving rental costs up. So there is sort of trickle down impact here.



LAPHONZA BUTLER:
Recent Washington Post analysis showed that Gen Z is spending 31 percent more on housing than their millennial counterparts were 10 -- were 10 years ago after adjusting for inflation. How do you view -- that was a long lead in to just ask the question, how do you envision or view the interest rates of today and the monetary balance -- and policy balancing that the Fed is doing on contributing to the future generation predicament if we are to extrapolate the conditions of today?


JEROME POWELL:
So, the -- our job, of course, is the whole economy and inflation for the whole economy. And the absolute best thing we can do for younger people is to restore price stability so that, as we benefited from -- you know, I -- I graduated from college in 1975, near the end of the big inflation period. So, during most of my adult life, inflation has just been not a factor.

And that means, you know, stable interest rates, relatively low interest rates. We want to get back to that, and that's -- that is what the Fed's job is, is that we're not -- we're not supposed to look at the housing market as separate from the -- of the overall economy. In the meantime, though, there's no question that higher interest rates are making it harder to buy homes in the -- in the short term.

But in the longer term, this is the best thing for -- particularly for younger people who are not yet in the housing market.


LAPHONZA BUTLER:
Let me -- sort of in line with that community, constituency, population, and definitely aligned with the concerns of my state, that's actually facing some severe climate impacts just as we speak with wildfires, and our colleagues and -- and fellow Americans in Texas and the impact of the hurricane, I wanted to pull in your sort of thoughts about the Fed pilot on the climate scenario exercise.

In May, the Fed conducted a pilot climate scenario exercise and asked the six largest US banks to examine their balance sheets and how it would be affected if a large hurricane hit the northeast. They reported facing data gaps on property characteristics, their counterparties and insurance coverage. How does the Federal Reserve intend to invest in expanding the modeling resources for banks that are going to be -- that are implementing climate related financial disclosures?


JEROME POWELL:
So, we haven't made any decisions on what to do with that information or whether to repeat that exercise. To your point, it was really a learning exercise, you know, how are banks thinking about this and how are they modeling it and -- and how does it -- how does it work, really. It's -- it's very, very challenging thing to model, and so that was really the nature of this exercise.

In terms of disclosures, you know, we don't really have a -- that's not really our -- our job. That's really the SEC. So -- but, you know, we're -- our -- we don't have a big job on climate. But what it really is is to make sure that the institutions we regulate are aware of and understand the risks that -- that they run, including risks from climate.


LAPHONZA BUTLER:
And that -- and that they're prepared and -- and -- and learning how to -- learning how to -- as I -- as -- would be the point of a pilot, learning how to mitigate those risks over -- over time. So, what -- what criteria will you use to evaluate whether or not you will run the exercise again and/or share the -- more broadly the -- the results of that exercise?


JEROME POWELL:
I think we did publish, well, most of the results of that exercise, so I -- I don't know what to say about that. We're -- we're looking at it, and we're asking ourselves what did we learn, what do we need to learn next time. So, I -- you know, I'm -- I'm not exactly sure what -- what factors we'll be looking at, but we'll be doing a -- a careful assessment of what more we need to do.


LAPHONZA BUTLER:
Thanks. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.


SHERROD BROWN:
Senator Hagerty is recognized.


WILLIAM HAGERTY:
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Powell, welcome. Chairman, last week in Portugal, you said that you wanted to be, quote, "more confident" that inflation is moving sustainably down before you begin to cut rates. You also said in your testimony that you need greater confidence and more good data before lowering rates.

Can you give us any color as to what it is you're looking for in the data and how long it might take us to get there?


JEROME POWELL:
We need just to see more good inflation data. That's all. We -- you know, we had seven months of good inflation data at the end of last year. Then we had a quarter, really a month or so, where inflation went up. And now it may be -- we had one -- one really good inflation reading and one pretty good one.

We just need to see more so that confidence rises. I'm not gonna tell you --


WILLIAM HAGERTY:
Just more? Are we weeks away, months away? Can you say?


JEROME POWELL:
Yeah, I mean, I'm going to try to avoid sending any really specific signals about time today, because it's going to depend on the data. It also matters what's going on in the labor market, though. And we've also said that, if the labor market weakens unexpectedly, that could be a case for -- for -- for loosening policy as well.

Really, we're weighing both those factors.


WILLIAM HAGERTY:
Here's -- here's one of my concerns. I'm sure you probably share it. But we're coming off of a 40 year high in inflation. We've seen the rate of inflation coming down, but we haven't gotten to the two percent target. And my concern, for lack of a better term, is whether or not this might be transitory in terms of the data that we're seeing right now.


JEROME POWELL:
That's exactly why we're -- we're -- why we're approaching this question carefully.


WILLIAM HAGERTY:
I thought that might be your -- your answer. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Can we shift now to the issuance of Treasury debt? You know, the Fed is the largest holder of Treasury debt. In February, you and I talked about the pressures that our fiscal deficit is exerting on interest rates, which by extension makes your job more difficult.

I'd like to talk this time about how Treasury issuance is impacting our economy and our monetary policy. First, just a basic question. If -- if Treasury issuance were to shift drastically either to the long end or the short end of the curve, would that affect interest rates? Or -- or maybe more simply, do changes in supply across maturities impact interest rates and the yield curve?


JEROME POWELL:
I mean, I think in -- in theory they can.


WILLIAM HAGERTY:
Yeah, I -- I -- I agree. As you know, the Treasury Borrowing Advisory Committee recommends that T-bills comprise between 15 and 20 percent of total US debt. But right now, the Treasury is issuing T-bills significantly above that recommended range. Some people, including myself, believe that this is being done to artificially stimulate markets in the run up to the election, and it's shocking how little attention this is getting.

Any manipulation of debt management of this nature stimulates inflationary pressures and increases taxpayer burden, because it's higher cost to issue these bills. So, given that Treasury is issuing an excess of short term debt, which pulls down longer term rates, isn't it working at cross purposes with your monetary policy goals of taming inflation?


JEROME POWELL:
So, we -- we take -- we take Treasury's debt management decisions. We don't comment on them. We just do our job. So, I'm not gonna --


WILLIAM HAGERTY:
Well, I'm not asking for a comment on their decision. But just as a simple mathematical truth, if they're pulling down demand on the long end of the curve, doesn't that work at --


JEROME POWELL:
I -- I wouldn't say that that has important inflation implications, no.


WILLIAM HAGERTY:
You know, it -- it just feels to me, the same way that the -- the Biden administration drains the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, that undermines our ability to respond to energy shocks. When the Treasury manages its debt in this manner, it constrains our ability to respond to future economic shocks. And that opens us to -- opens our nation up to very real risk, whether it be amplifying the effects of the Fed's balance sheet reduction, flooding the supply of one of the most important short term debt instruments.

The risks seem to me to be mounting for Treasury market disruption. I'd like to know what your thoughts are, Mr. Chairman, about how the Fed will navigate this and whether you've had discussions with the Treasury about this growing dangerously -- dangerous dynamic.


JEROME POWELL:
No, we don't have a seat at the table on Treasury debt management. Treasury makes those decisions. And they don't have a seat at our table on monetary policy. We don't have a seat at the --


WILLIAM HAGERTY:
I just think the risk is very obvious here, though, where we're -- where we're headed with this type of portfolio management.


JEROME POWELL:
Honestly, it's just -- it's -- it's completely out of bounds for me to comment on Treasury debt management in any way.


WILLIAM HAGERTY:
Well, I think you've been dealt a very difficult hand here, Mr. Chair. The Biden administration's policies aim to gin up the economy ahead of the election. These efforts directly undermine your policy goals at the Fed. That includes excessive issuance of short term debt. Think about it. Freddie Mac's backstop of second mortgages, unlawful student debt loan content -- cancellations, the draining of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to suppress fuel prices, and President Biden's own jawboning of the FOMC to lower rates.

As you know, the Federal Reserve was structured to shield monetary policy from political influence, and that independence has given the Fed unique credibility in executing its mission. If the FOMC were influenced in any way by political calculation rather than economic data, it would severely damage the Fed's credibility as an independent institution.

It would increase uncertainty in our markets, and it would jeopardize the dollar's status as the global reserve currency. Thank you, Mr. Chair.


SHERROD BROWN:
Senator Warren of Massachusetts is recognized.


ELIZABETH WARREN:
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. When the CEOs of giant banks can boost their bonuses by getting the banks to take on more risk, they run the risk that they will end up running their banks into the ground. It happened in 2008 and it happened again in 2023. Back in 2010, though, Congress passed the Dodd-Frank Act. Section 956 told financial regulators, solve this problem.

Two months ago, regulators put forward a proposal, but the Fed refused to join. Now in 2018, you told this committee, Mr. Chairman, that you, quote, expect that banks will have in place compensation plans that do not provide incentives for excessive risk taking. In other words, you trusted the banks to write their own rules, so let's see if they actually have.

One thing the proposal would do is require big banks to delay bonuses for a broad group of critical employees who are able to gamble with the bank's finances, like the head of a trading desk, for example. Chair Powell, in the six and a half years since you said trust the banks to regulate themselves, how many of the ten biggest banks have put policies in place to delay annual bonuses for this broader group of critical employees whose risk taking could endanger the bank?


JEROME POWELL:
I -- I don't know specifically. My guess is all of them since -- since the financial crisis.


ELIZABETH WARREN:
So, you're -- you're the regulator who said trust the banks to self-regulate so we can avoid another financial meltdown or another bailout. And you don't know if they did or didn't do that?


JEROME POWELL:
Well, you make a -- it's a very, very specific narrow question you're asking about --


ELIZABETH WARREN:
That is a very specific thing, because --


JEROME POWELL:
About --


ELIZABETH WARREN:
It's something a regulator should. You think the answer is ten out of ten. The answer is zero out of 10.


JEROME POWELL:
Yeah, I -- I doubt that.


ELIZABETH WARREN:
Well, go back and look, because we've looked at their statements on this. Another thing the proposed rule would do is require the banks to consider flat out banning bonuses and bonus pay for executives who took risks that threatened the stability of the bank. So, let me ask you this one, Chair Powell. In the six and a half years since you said trust the banks to regulate themselves, how many of the ten biggest banks now have policies that would require them to flat out deny bonuses to executives that have engaged in inappropriate risk taking?


JEROME POWELL:
I -- I don't know the answer to that. By the way, I never said trust the banks to regulate themselves.


ELIZABETH WARREN:
I'm sorry. Do you want me to go back and quote you again exactly?


JEROME POWELL:
Trust the banks to regulate themselves?


ELIZABETH WARREN:
When you say I expect that the banks will have in place compensation plans that do not provide incentives for excessive risk taking --


JEROME POWELL:
Right, pursuant to the --


ELIZABETH WARREN:
I take that as --


JEROME POWELL:
Pursuant to the -- to the guidance that we issued in 2010, which is quite detailed.


ELIZABETH WARREN:
And you have not issued a guidance since you made these comments, since you became chair. And how many banks have actually put in place the regulations that you said I expect the banks will have in place? The answer is, out of ten --


JEROME POWELL:
It was covered by --


ELIZABETH WARREN:
Zero.


JEROME POWELL:
The 2010 guidance.


ELIZABETH WARREN:
No, you said in 2018 that they would put these in place.


JEROME POWELL:
I said they would have in place.


ELIZABETH WARREN:
No, that is not what you said. So, look, Chair Powell, the last guidance on this subject, as you say, was in 2010, which is before you were at the Fed. The Fed has now refused to join the other financial regulators in finalizing a rule implementing Section 956 as Congress directed. So, my question has been how many of the ten biggest banks have done this, and the answer is zero.

Dodd-Frank was passed 14 years ago. There are still no rules to stop banks from rewarding executives' risky behavior. When you were asked about these Section 956 rules or lack of rules in March of this year, you said, quote, that you wanted to understand the problem we're solving before proposing a rule.

Chair Powell, the law does not say Jerome Powell, in his infinite wisdom, should decide if we have a problem with executive compensation. The law passed 14 years ago says executive pay is a problem that threatens the stability of our economy, so write the rules to rein them in. Finally, finally, the other financial regulators have proposed such a rule, but the Fed has not joined.

Chair Powell, I understand why the ten biggest banks in the country like your approach. You'll let them do whatever they want. But you don't work for the giant banks. You work for the American people. I urge you to do your job. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.


SHERROD BROWN:
Senator Vance from Ohio is recognized.


J.D. VANCE:
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thanks, Chair Powell, for being here. I appreciate you coming by our office last week to discuss some of these issues. I -- I want to ask something I imagine most of my colleagues are not asking, which is the relationship between immigration, particularly extremely high illegal immigration levels under the Biden administration, and the persistence of the inflation problem.

And I recognize this is not your -- your policy focus, but you are the federal chair -- Federal Reserve chairman, so I just want to get your -- your -- your views on this. And in particular, I want to read you a quote from Mike -- Mickey Bowman, who is one of your governors. And this says in a quote, "There's a risk that increased immigration and continued labor market tightness could lead to persistently high core services inflation."

Given the current low inventory of affordable housing, the inflow of new immigrants in some geographic areas could result in upward pressure on rents, as additional housing supply may take time to materialize. With labor markets remaining tight, wage growth has been elevated at around or above four percent, still higher than the pace consistent with our two percent inflation goal, given trend productivity growth.

The Bank of England, I believe, produced a recent report on -- on this issue in the United Kingdom, obviously a different economy and a different country. But what do you see as the relationship, in particular given that housing is such a big driver of the inflation that we've seen over the last few years, as Senator Hagerty said, the highest in 40 years?

What role do you see illegal immigration playing in driving up housing costs, which of course is a main driver of inflation for American citizens?


JEROME POWELL:
Let me quickly start by echoing your first comment, which is we don't -- we don't comment on immigration policy, but we do comment on inflation.


J.D. VANCE:
Yeah.


JEROME POWELL:
So, I would say this. Many people came into the country over the last couple of years, many of them through asylum requests, and went to work. Labor supply increased a great deal. It -- it's not -- there's no clear answer, but my -- my -- my sense is that, in the long run, immigration is kind of neutral on inflation.

In the short run, it may actually have helped because the labor market got looser because there were more people. But to your -- you're talking about housing specifically. There -- there will be -- I'm sure there are places in the country where -- where new people coming into the country, you can -- I'm sure you can find places, and -- and they exist, where that will have contributed to an already tight housing market.

But overall, in the terms of aggregate inflation, I wouldn't say it's -- it's a driver one way or the other.


J.D. VANCE:
So, I -- I want to follow up on that thread, but just on -- on that topic of particular areas that have been affected. Chairman Brown, I'd like to ask unanimous consent to submit a letter for the record from the city of Springfield in our state, the -- the southwestern border of our state, which I think highlights a very real example of this particular concern straight from the horse's mouth itself.

And now -- now this letter, I want to quote from it, Springfield has seen a surge in population through immigration that has significantly impacted our ability as a community to produce enough housing opportunities for all. Springfield's Haitian population has increased 15 to 20,000 over the last four years in a community of under 60,000 previous residents, putting a significant strain on our resources and ability to provide ample housing for all of our residents, and end quote there.

And my --


SHERROD BROWN:
Without objection, so ordered.


J.D. VANCE:
Thank -- thank you. In -- in my conversations with folks in Springfield, it's not just housing. They're trying to build 5,000 new housing units, which is a very Herculean task in a town of about 55,000 people. But it's also hospital services. It's school services. It's -- there are a whole host of ways in which this immigration problem, I think, is having very real human consequences.

But let me go back to just -- just one other question, Chair Powell, on -- on this -- on this -- this immigration and labor supply question. So, one of the -- the euphemistic ways in which economists I think sometimes talk about labor supply and immigration is they'll say something to the effect of, well, an increase in labor supply has put downward pressure on labor prices.

And what they're effectively saying is that increased immigration has put downward pressure on the wages of American workers. I wonder, you know, when you hear sort of your colleagues and other economists outside of the Fed talk about the influx of immigration and the fact that it I think admittedly has put downward pressure on wages, OK, so they're -- obviously, that has put some downward pressure on inflation, but it also puts downward pressure on the wages that people earn to pay for their families.

Why do we see that as a good thing? Or maybe that's wrong. Maybe the premise is fundamentally incorrect. But why do so many economists treat an influx of new labor as a good thing? If labor is constrained, labor supply is constrained, doesn't that lead to rising wages for American workers?


JEROME POWELL:
So, we're not -- I don't -- I'm not -- certainly not trying to put a value judgment on it.


J.D. VANCE:
Fair.


JEROME POWELL:
I will say, though, this is all happening over the last couple of years in a context of an extremely tight labor market. Now a little bit less tight, significantly less tight. But you -- you've got a worker shortage, you've got businesses who have jobs that are open. You have, you know, more than one job opening for every unemployed person.

So, you've got a very tight labor market and it's addressing that. And we're having -- wage increases are still very high, but they're coming down to a more sustainable level.


J.D. VANCE:
Fair. And Mr. Chair, could I -- I know I'm over time. Could I just ask just one more question on this? Thank you. I -- I understand your point, Chair Powell. And again, I'm not ascribing value judgments to you. But if -- if we say we have a really tight labor market and we say that there are more than one job openings per worker, there are two ways you could plausibly solve that, probably more than that, but two obvious ways you could plausibly solve that.

One is through a new influx of workers via the immigration system. Another way is by raising wages and bringing some of the workers that are on the sidelines. I'm thinking specifically of the seven million prime age men that have dropped out of the labor force. Like, why isn't that more the focus of policymakers rather than -- you know, you see a labor shortage.

Rather than bringing in a large number of new immigrants, why not try to boost wages in a way that brings some of those workers off the sidelines? That seems to be a much better focus, from my perspective.


JEROME POWELL:
Certainly that's a very constructive focus. I would agree. It's not -- I don't think it has to be one or the other.


J.D. VANCE:
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.


SHERROD BROWN:
Senator Van Hollen from Maryland is recognized.


CHRIS VAN HOLLEN:
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Powell, it's good to see you. And let me first applaud you and your team at the Fed for at least so far being on track to bring down inflation without so far triggering a surge, a big uptick in unemployment. But you know very well that that's a risk if the Fed does not act with full awareness of that -- of that danger.

When you were here in March, you said that you were "well aware" of the risk to unemployment of waiting too long to cut rates and "very conscious of avoiding it." Since then, we have seen a slowing in the economy and a rise in unemployment. I'm just reading something today, an analysis with Diane Swonk, KPMG's chief economist, who summed it up by saying "The ice is thinning.

Red flags are emerging for the US economy." The engine of the economy, the labor market is cooling faster than previously known. The unemployment rate is above 4 percent for the first time since 2021. It is taking workers longer to find jobs. Economic activity in the service sector, which is responsible for two-thirds of economic growth, slowed in June.

So, my question, Mr. Chairman, is how do you take all of these factors into account? Are you -- do you share my concern that as of today there is a real risk of a increase in unemployment larger than is currently on your radar screen?


JEROME POWELL:
Yeah, I mean, absolutely we -- we -- I do, even more so than in March when we were here, see that. So, we've seen, and I think the latest data show, that labor market conditions have now cooled considerably from where they were two years ago. And I wouldn't have said that until the last couple of readings.

And I would say also that the -- you know, for a long time, the risks were more that we would fail to hit our inflation target. I think the risks as to the two statutory targets we have, price stability and maximum employment, I think those are coming much more into balance. My colleagues and I are looking at that, and we fully understand that we have to manage this process of -- of -- of administering the federal funds rate and deciding what to do with it in a way that manages both of those risks.

And, you know, the two mandates are equal under the law. And -- and so, yes, we do get that.


CHRIS VAN HOLLEN:
Well, I -- I appreciate that. And I appreciate the fact that you've seen that sort of -- that calculation change since you were last here, because I think the data indicates that we are at risk now of not acting soon enough to curb the increase in unemployment, and that if we allow that to go too long, we may see a real uptick there.

And so, I -- I'm -- I'm pleased that that is very, very much on your radar screen and hope that that will be a -- a really deciding factor as you and your other Fed colleagues determine what to do with respect to interest rates. And as had been said, in the housing sector, we are seeing the continuing drag created by high interest rates.

So, that has been a -- I think all of our colleagues, as you probably heard today, are really hearing from our constituents, understandably, about the very high housing prices. And it's slowed investment in other sectors like manufacturing as well. In my final minute, I would like to turn to the -- the question that Senator Warren asked, because I asked your colleague, Vice Chair Barr, about exactly this question of implementing Section 956 of Dodd-Frank when he was before the committee just a short time ago, May 16th of this year.

And I asked him about why the Fed had not moved forward along with other agencies with respect to implementing what the law is and what the law has been for ten years. NCUA has signaled their intent to propose a rule. The SEC has indicated that they're moving forward. I said to Vice Chair Barr that I've not seen any notice of proposed rule from the Fed, and can I get a commitment that the Fed will quickly begin the process implementing this law by issuing a notice of proposed rule.

His answer was, and I'm quoting, in discussions with my colleagues, it became apparent that at the board we believe we need to conduct some further analysis before deciding what steps to take. We are committed to following the law to implementing Section 956, but we have further work to do. Count me among those who are very frustrated that we're now ten years after this law was passed.

Vice Chair Barr, committed to following the law. I'm sure, Mr. Chairman, you would commit to following the law. But why is it that it's taking the Fed so long to move forward with implementation of 956?


JEROME POWELL:
So, I like to look at the actual language of the statute when I -- and what it says is, it calls on the regulatory -- regulators to make determinations about specific incentive compensation practices that cause excessive risk taking. And then -- and we haven't done that. We -- so, we did -- you know that we put in place pretty serious guidance back in 2010 after putting it out for comment.

We looked at all these questions. It's been in place for -- for 14 years. We supervise on it. And, you know, so the question I'm asking is, OK, let's just -- let's go out and look at what the practices are that are happening now, not that are happening before the global financial crisis, when it was obvious that things needed to be changed and we put the guidance in place.

It seems to have largely worked, certainly as it relates to the large firms. And then let's design something that is designed to the residual risk as opposed to just taking something off the shelf from 15 years ago and doing that. So, that -- and we're -- we're -- we're working on that at the Fed now. And again, I am -- the -- the statute requires us to prescribe regulations or guidelines to prohibit -- prohibit those things.

And I -- you know, I want to do that. In a sense, we have done that.


CHRIS VAN HOLLEN:
So, just -- just very briefly, when -- is it your -- is it your testimony that the Fed has already met the requirements of --


JEROME POWELL:
No.


CHRIS VAN HOLLEN:
OK.


JEROME POWELL:
No.


CHRIS VAN HOLLEN:
Just want to make that clear. And we do look forward to the Fed moving forward. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.


SHERROD BROWN:
Thank you, Senator Van Hollen. Senator Britt from Alabama is recognized.


KATIE BRITT:
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chair Powell, thank you for being with us today. My colleague from Maryland actually just touched on something. But as I was listening to the exchange from my colleague from Massachusetts, and in her closing remarks, particularly about Dodd-Frank and 956, there was also a comment at the end where she mentioned you working for giant banks versus the American people.

Now, I have a long list of questions I want to talk to you about, but I did want to get you to respond to that.


JEROME POWELL:
Yeah, that's completely untrue. You know, we're -- the things that we're doing are -- are consistent with our international obligations, and they're meant to be the -- the best thing for the American economy. And that's -- that's really our only consideration. We have policy differences across various things, but you know, we're all trying to achieve the best results we can for the people that we serve.


KATIE BRITT:
Absolutely. Thank you. Chair Powell, I have repeatedly talked about my concern with long term debt proposal, and just think that it has not been well thought through. First, I have concerns that it blatantly undermines the tailoring requirement. And on that note, do you believe that 2155 will be applicable to the long term debt requirement?


JEROME POWELL:
I -- I think it applies to everything.


KATIE BRITT:
Absolutely.


JEROME POWELL:
And on the long term debt requirement, you know, we have voluminous comments that we're -- that we're looking at carefully and -- and thinking through the process of what to do about them.


KATIE BRITT:
No, I appreciate that, because I do believe that currently it lacks a real cost-benefit analysis, and I think it really does need serious reconsideration. And additionally, when you take a look at it and its overlapping nature with Basel III, it seems inappropriate that we would move forward with a new long term debt proposal finalizing that rule when we don't even really understand what Basel III is going to mean for capital requirements for banks and -- and obviously financial institutions.

So, my question for you is -- is just that. Would it be inappropriate to move forward with the long term debt proposal finalizing that rule prior to Basel III being finalized as well?




JEROME POWELL:
I -- I don't know that I would give you -- I can't give you a clear answer on that. It will depend. I mean Basel III won't be finally finalized for some time, but that's not to say we wouldn't reach a place where people understand and accept and support what it is that we're doing. And then I think at that point, we could certainly move forward with -- with other rules.


KATIE BRITT:
I heard you mention to one of my other colleagues that probably by the time this all took place it would be the beginning of next year. I would just say my concern, the Fed has said that the long term debt rule will directly be impacted by the final Basel product. And so, you know, why would it be inappropriate or appropriate to move forward with that before banks can fully understand what they're facing from Basel?

So I would just ask that you're thoughtful about that. These are a lot of things that people are dealing with and trying to really understand the implications of. And I think we have seen consistently that people are not taking a look at the cumulative impact of these things and not really taking a look at the trickledown effect.

And -- and on that, on Basel, when you testified in March, you said the Fed was aware and fully considering the potential impacts of a proposal on our commodities markets, and I do want to talk about that. The commodities market, our agriculture industry is one in five jobs in the state of Alabama, it's 20 percent of our economy.

I am a big believer food security is national security and the proposal would increase hedging costs by 80 percent, meaning banks would be far less likely or inclined to offer clearing services. So this could have a detrimental effect to our agriculture community and increase other costs providing food and fiber for our nation.

When you look at inputs such as feed, seed, fertilizer prices, those have skyrocketed and prices have ended up just getting passed down to the consumer. I mean, grocery prices are up 21 percent since January. So do you believe that the revised Basel proposal will alleviate these concerns that our farmers and our ag community have had about Basel III? And has the Fed done anything specifically to take a look at this?

And if not, will you commit to doing so?


JEROME POWELL:
So I don't want to get into the specific changes that we're going to make. I'll just say that we're very well aware of and very focused on that particular set of changes and, you know, paying a close -- paying close attention to the issues you've raised.


KATIE BRITT:
I appreciate that and I also hope that the Fed craft -- when you craft these types of regulation, you really consider the relationship between the economic impact and the ability of community banks to serve their communities as well. I have heard you mention that to another one of my colleagues so I know that you're committed to doing that, but that is incredibly important to Alabamians and our main streets all across the state.

In my last few seconds, I want to touch on one more topic. So finding solutions to expanding affordable child care is a top priority of mine and it is something that I know a number of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle share an interest in and believe is an important issue as well. So Chair Powell, do you believe that increasing access to affordable child care would positively impact labor participation in our country?


JEROME POWELL:
I do believe that.


KATIE BRITT:
Thank you.


SHERROD BROWN:
[Off-mic] Masto of Nevada's recognized.


CATHERINE CORTEZ MASTO:
Thank you. Excuse me. Chairman Powell, thank you for joining us and I always appreciate visiting with you in my office as well and your comments. Let me start by a comment you made in the opening. Over the past two years, you said the economy has made considerable progress toward the Federal Reserve's two percent inflation goal.

Labor market conditions have cooled while remaining strong, reflecting these developments, the risks to achieving our employment and inflation goals are coming into better balance. And what we know is that since Biden came into office, the United States has added over 15 million jobs. Under President Biden, we had 41 consecutive months of job growth and you just said it again here today that wages are up as well.

Average US wages and salaries grew by nearly what 16,700 between January 2021 and April 2024. So would you agree with the statement by our ranking member earlier today that the US has the greatest economy on the planet?


JEROME POWELL:
I certainly would.


CATHERINE CORTEZ MASTO:
Let me ask you this, um jumping around and there's been talks today about the Fed's independence and how important the Fed's independence is. The Wall Street Journal recently reported former Trump administration officials drafted policy options to weaken the independence of the Federal Reserve if President Trump were to be elected in November.

Allegedly, former administration officials discussed policy options to erode the Fed's independence, to make it easier for a president to impact interest rate decisions or fire the Fed chair at will. Chairman Powell, how important is it that the Fed has independence to provide economic stability and anchor our inflation expectations?


JEROME POWELL:
So I think it's -- it's actually essential, it's literally essential. And the good news is I think that's pretty broadly understood and particularly in -- on Capitol Hill among on both sides of the aisle. I believe that people do understand that we need to do our work in a way that's outside the political process to the maximum extent possible.

Of course, we need to be accountable and tremendously transparent. If you look at the box in the monetary policy report on central bank independence, it's really a box about transparency. That's the other side. So I think it's really important. I think it's an institutional arrangement that has served the public well.

And, you know, and I do believe that there's pretty wide support for it.


CATHERINE CORTEZ MASTO:
And you just said that it has been intentional and institutional arrangement over the years for this very reason, correct?


JEROME POWELL:
Yes, this is a choice that we make and it's -- I think it's -- countries around the world, advanced economies have all made this choice effectively and the results are clear that you now have independent central banks and you have better anchored inflation expectations and you have better performance on inflation and better performance in the economy generally.

Which isn't to say there won't be shocks and crises and that kind of thing.


CATHERINE CORTEZ MASTO:
And then let me touch on a subject that one of my colleagues just talked about because I was going to ask about this, which is our immigration. In Nevada, immigrants are extremely important for our economy. They're essential workers, doctors, nurses, and teachers in my community. Can you -- without getting into other ancillary issues that don't impact what you do, can you talk about and elaborate on how immigration affects the employment rate and why you look at it and for what reason you look at the immigration issue?


JEROME POWELL:
So we -- again, we don't -- as you -- just to make the point that you made, we don't take a position, we don't comment on -- on immigration policy. We have no responsibility for it. It's not our job. But -- so we just look at the numbers and we sort of try to assess the economic consequences of immigration.

And over the last two years, we've -- we've -- we -- two years ago, we had an economy where we really had a labor shortage. And what's happened is we've had a wave of immigration and those -- many of those people have gone to work and gone to work legally through the -- through the -- the asylum process, not all of them.

There's also a group that has not -- that has not been legally processed, but many of this latest group have been -- have -- have sought asylum and then gotten -- gone through the process of getting a work permit. So what that means is that we're -- employers wanted workers and there's -- there are now -- there were -- there were more job openings than there were people actively seeking work or working.

And -- and so now you have a new supply of workers and they filled those jobs. So we have a bigger economy, but it's not a tighter economy because labor supply has increased the economic capacity. That's just the arithmetic, that's not saying it's a good thing or a bad thing. There are other policy choices that could be made and they're not for us to make.


CATHERINE CORTEZ MASTO:
When you say greater -- a greater economy --


JEROME POWELL:
A larger economy.


CATHERINE CORTEZ MASTO:
In other words, it has improved the growth of our economy?


JEROME POWELL:
The economy grew three point something percent, 3.4 percent I believe last year. And some part of that was that as Congressional Budget Office analysis showed and to many surprise, there had been a really significant uncounted group of workers coming into the country who had gone to work. And -- and that's part of the story of how the economy managed to grow that much while inflation was coming down pretty sharply.

Inflation came down two full percentage points during 2023 while the economy was growing at 3.4 percent. So and while these people were coming in, so that is part of the explanation for why we had such an interesting and pretty good year in 2023.


CATHERINE CORTEZ MASTO:
Thank you.


SHERROD BROWN:
Senator Cramer of North Dakota is recognized.


KEVIN CRAMER:
Hi, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, chairman. As always, all of my prep goes out the window with the last question. So on the legal immigration workforce front, and I know this isn't your bailiwick, but the issue of workforce is important to the economy. I would submit to my colleagues beyond even the people who come here seeking asylum suddenly being available for the workforce, we have a million plus people who we welcome in legally every year, the vast majority of whom don't come in with a job or even a skill set or -- and we have so much work to do, colleagues, on the legal immigration front to -- to -- to create a connection between economic demands for workers and the skill set and education that that our immigrants bring to us. So most every other country requires some sort of skill set useful in the economy.

We don't do much of that. So that's just my speech for the moment. I know, Mr. Chairman, you've gotten already lots of very specific questions and I've heard a couple of them on Basel III. So I'm just going to make an illustration and you can comment on it if you'd like, but there's a large generation and transmission utility in North Dakota, Rural Electric Cooperatives, based in electric, very large G and T members all over the Upper Midwest and they recently testified in front of the CFTC on Basel III and they -- they expressed a concern about how operations would be impacted if lending was curtailed or limited in any way and they gave a real world example.

And I want to just give you that example. Now remember, this is an electricity supply that we're talking about. It's -- it's critical it remains reliable. It's critical that it remains affordable. And part of an electric cooperatives risk management program of course is how it buys the fuel that generates the electricity, in this case natural gas.

They'll -- they may buy natural gas in advance at a fixed price, realizing natural gas is one of those commodities that goes up -- up and down and pretty big swings at times, but -- but they -- they can hedge by buying it at a fixed price for power plant. And it protects the cooperative financially since electricity prices again follow those spot prices generally.

So spot prices spike, so do electricity prices. However, with a natural gas hedge, the cooperative can generate electricity at a lower fixed fuel cost, protecting itself and its consumers from high prices. It's an up -- upfront cost on the balance sheet between the cooperative and its bank, but it protects the reliability and affordable supply of electricity.

I give you that very specific example, not even to mention that the cooperative model itself has -- has some unique qualities about it. If you would like to comment on it, you've already stated that they're going to have to be changes. I just throw that into your -- your box of things to think about and you're welcome to comment if you'd like.


JEROME POWELL:
I'll just say we're well aware of that issue and I appreciate you bringing it up.


KEVIN CRAMER:
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. With that then I just -- I'm just going to speak to this independence issue. I think that the senators that have questioned you on it are correct. I share that concern as you know that the independence of the Fed is essential. I have resisted moves within my own party to change it, but those moves are very narrow and not very -- I don't think very realistic.

And I appreciate you pointing out that from what you can tell at least on Capitol Hill, we're all pretty much united on that front. Perception does matter. It matters a great deal and you and I have had discussions over the years on -- you were very -- you admonished us strongly as Congress to spend what we needed to spend to get through the pandemic and to maintain the economy.

I -- I think you were right to do that. You were -- you were just as aggressive in not responding to -- to calls to -- to rein it in a little bit when Democrats brought the -- the Inflation Reduction Act and the American Rescue Plan to the forefront and I think really basically hijacked the economy and put fuel on inflation.

But perception matters and so I would just submit to you and you haven't said you're going to do this, I don't have any reason to believe you'll do this, but -- but any -- any move to lower interest rates or move interest rates either direction before November 5th could certainly be a bad perception even if there's even if there's a strong push to do that.

I know you understand that, but I just want you to know that as long as you remain independent, I'll have -- I'll be on your side. I think neutral is a good place to be. And by the way, you have one of those jobs where being boring is one of the most noble things you can be. So great job. Thank -- thank you.


JEROME POWELL:
Thank you. We do our best.


SHERROD BROWN:
Thank you, Senator Cramer. Senator Warnock is recognized, who is decidedly not boring. [Laughter]


RAPHAEL WARNOCK:
Clearly not. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. The latest monetary policy report shows inflation is -- in housing costs is gradually easing. That's good news. Um, but many Georgians still feel the sting of unaffordable homes and mortgages. And one reason for this, you and I have discussed this is that we aren't building enough houses.

A 2022 study published in the Journal of Economic Geography found that for every 10 percent increase in the housing stock, rents decreased by one percent. We've discussed this issue, particularly the effects of housing supply on housing costs. And we agreed that while the Federal Reserve does not control housing supply uh, it can help create the environment that encourages the construction of new housing, particularly affordable housing -- housing.

Chair Powell, how has the Fed been working to foster an environment that encourages home construction? And what, in your view, are the challenges that remain?


JEROME POWELL:
Um, so I mean, in the long run, the absolute best thing we can do for the housing market and for the economy is to sustainably bring inflation back down so that people aren't talking about it anymore. And it's -- it's just assumed by everybody in their daily lives that inflation will be around two percent, so we don't need to talk about it, which is where we were for a long time.

We want to get back to that. Interest rates can come down then and the housing market can return to the state it was in before the pandemic, which was to say really tight. We don't have enough housing and that's not really a monetary policy issue. Um, in -- in the short term though, you know, I would say housing -- uh, tight monetary policy weighs on the -- on the housing market.

You know, we -- the policy works through interest sensitive spending. And housing is -- is definitely at the top of the list of interest sensitive spending. So we understand that, um, you know, we're -- we're suppressing not not suppressing, but our -- our higher interest rates, uh, you know, have led to lower housing starts and and -- and lower activity in the housing market.

But we're doing that to get back to two percent inflation for the whole economy so that the housing market can be on a better foundation.


RAPHAEL WARNOCK:
Well, yeah, and related to that, when you have these high interest rates, of course, um, you see across the country, but particularly in a state like Georgia, um, these uh, institutional investors who are coming into the space and they're buying houses in all cash, boxing out first time, first generation homebuyers.

And of course, the conditions for them doing that improved to their favor with -- with higher interest rates. Um, would you agree with that assessment?


JEROME POWELL:
I know some of that's happening. I don't know that higher interest rates make it -- I mean, some of that's -- they're working with --


RAPHAEL WARNOCK:
Well, if -- if you got higher interest rates and you've got institutional buyers who can purchase at all cash, doesn't that --


JEROME POWELL:
But they have to borrow the money at a higher interest rate. I'm just saying higher interest rates doesn't make their -- their investment any cheaper. And notwithstanding, I understand this is a sensitive issue. And in some -- most markets, it's still a pretty small portion of the outstanding housing stock.

But it's -- and it's not an issue -- it's not an issue for us, you know? They are a legal buyer of housing. Our -- our job is really the whole economy. Um, I mean it's -- it's more of a question for -- for legislatures.


RAPHAEL WARNOCK:
So -- so how -- how can the Fed better deploy its monetary tools to ensure that we are meeting key inflation objectives like housing affordability?


JEROME POWELL:
You know, I think the -- the best thing we can do is to -- is kind of what we -- what we think we've been doing, which is to move carefully as we think about -- about loosening policy. And make sure that once -- that we do that when we've got greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably down toward to percent.

Um, we're also keeping a close eye on the labor market. And if we see unexpected weakening there, then we could respond to that, too. But that's -- that's really the best thing we can do for the whole economy and very specifically for the housing market, too.


RAPHAEL WARNOCK:
Yeah, you -- and you well point Out that you're limited in terms of your influence there. And there is a role for Congress to be sure, um, which is one of the reasons I wanted to be on this committee to introduce a Downpayment uh, Toward Equity Act, with my colleague Senator Butler. This bill would help first generation home buyers compete with Wall Street institutional investors by helping with down payment costs, closing costs and costs to reduce interest rates.

I look forward to continuing uh, productive conversations with you and looking at how we can make housing more affordable uh, for all Americans. Um, if -- I'm running out of time here, but one of the other concerns that I -- I uh, maintain is with respect to reducing the racial wealth gap, um, is this issue around home appraisals.

And the Fed is part of the Inter-Agency Task Force on Property Appraisal and Valuation Equity. What expertise and perspective has the Fed bought -- brought to this task force? Um, and you know, how are you responding to this issue of -- of home appraisals?


JEROME POWELL:
So as you know, we've been a, you know, an active participant in that task force. And you know, we bring all of the expertise we have in the housing market as well as regulatory supervisory and economic expertise generally, um, as we look at that. And I'll also say that uh, our strongly held view is that discrimination has no place in the -- in the banking system.

And that includes appraisals and other evaluations.


RAPHAEL WARNOCK:
I agree with that. And quickly, I was glad to see that CFPB and other agencies recently finalized a rule that creates strong anti-discrimination standards for uh, for automated home uh, evaluations. The Fed has not yet approved this rule. Why not? And does the Fed plan to do so?


JEROME POWELL:
Sorry, why do we?


RAPHAEL WARNOCK:
You've not yet approved the rule that was made uh, that -- uh, put -- put in -- that was suggested by the CFPB. They finalized a rule.


JEROME POWELL:
But do we -- sorry to your -- I didn't -- I'm not -- I'm not aware that we -- that it's a rule that we have to finalize, too. Is that the case?


RAPHAEL WARNOCK:
That is my understanding.


JEROME POWELL:
I will -- let me follow up with you on that. I'm not -- I'm not aware of that.


RAPHAEL WARNOCK:
OK. Thank you.


JEROME POWELL:
Thank you.


SHERROD BROWN:
Uh, Senator dime -- Daines of Montana is recognized.


STEVE DAINES:
Chairman, thank you. Chairman Powell, thanks for being here today. Certainly it's not lost on anybody here. Election season is in full swing. And so from now until Election Day, my democratic colleagues in Congress as well as the Biden-Harris administration will waste no time attempting to sell a fairy tale to the American people that financially and economically they are better off now than they were almost four years ago.

When President Biden took office, inflation was at 1.4 percent. His failed policies drove us to the highest inflation we've seen in 40 years. I can tell you the folks back home in Montana aren't fooled. Because in every part of their lives, inflation is not some kind of hypothetical. They see the everyday impacts of the decade's high inflation brought on by the policies of the Biden administration and facilitated by Congressional Democrats.

The cost of most goods and services across the economy are more expensive than they were in 2020. And that is a fact that no amount of political spin or mental gymnastics can make go away. Here's just a couple of examples. Breakfast cereal, prices have increased 28 percent since January of 2020. Gas prices increased 36 percent from a national average of $2.63 a gallon to $3.58 -- $3.58 per gallon.

Egg prices. Egg prices have jumped $3 per dozen in 2024, double the cost of $1.45 in February of 2020. And this dishonesty doesn't stop with inflation. On the labor market, while President Biden and Senate Democrats are celebrating a victory lap in light of the recent jobs report showing a 206,000 new jobs last month, they're willfully ignoring the fact that more than a third of these job gains came from the government sector.

Mr. Chairman, I commend you for the job you have done thus far in trying to rein in inflation. And encourage you to continue the fight despite the political pressures you may face. I'm also encouraged by the comments you made earlier this month about the dire need for Washington to address its fiscal imbalance.

I couldn't agree more. I've said many times and continue to believe that Washington's culture of reckless spending of excessive borrowing is leading us down a very dangerous path by leaving future generations with mountains of debt. And I'm happy to hear you agree with that assessment. Mr. Chairman, given that it's an election year, you're undoubtedly facing immense political pressure to lower rates.

Thus far, you've done an admirable job in using the tools at your disposal to fight inflation. And I urge you to continue to be led by data and not calendars or political influence. You said as recently as last week that while things are trending in the right direction, you would need to see further evidence before cutting rates.

So here's my question, Mr. Chairman. What specifically are you looking at and looking for as we head into the next FOMC meeting? And how do you factor in this recent labor data, and certainly the significant part of that being government jobs?


JEROME POWELL:
So we're looking for two things really. One is just more good inflation data. That we had quite a lot of good inflation data the last seven months of last year, then we had kind of a bump in inflation in the first quarter. And now we've had one good and one very good inflation reading. And we need more good data so that we can be confident that what we're seeing is really that's where inflation is going that it's going back down toward two percent.

We don't need to see it at two percent. Right now, we're at 2.6 percent. So that's -- that's on inflation on the labor market, to your question, um, we -- we've seen that the labor market has cooled really significantly uh, across so many measures. And a number of people here today have pointed them out, but.

And the unemployment rate has moved up. You see a labor market that is now pretty much in balance, pretty much where it was in 2019. It's not a source of broad inflationary pressures for the economy now, but it's still a strong labor market. You know, 4.1 percent unemployment is a very good and historically low unemployment rate.

So we want to -- we have a mandate to support maximum employment. And we also are paying close attention. And if we see that the labor market were weakening unexpectedly, which is to say, you know more than what we've seen in a material way, if we unexpectedly then we -- we could also respond to that because we have a dual mandate.

And we now see the two -- the two mandates as more in balance than they were. A year ago, really the focus had to be and was on inflation. Now we need to be focusing on both goals.


STEVE DAINES:
Chairman, thank you. I want to get one question on Basel III and then we will -- Uh, in March, this committee agreed that it was seriously flawed and needed to be completely rewritten. I was encouraged to see reports last month that the Federal Reserve had provided other financial regulations with possible changes to the proposal.

Uh, my question is I continue to believe the proposal should be scrapped altogether, but could you share what changes you're planning to make and the status of the ongoing development of the updated proposal?


JEROME POWELL:
So we've had extensive discussions led by Vice Chair for Supervision Barr, with the FDIC and the OCC. We've made a lot of progress in -- in getting close to an agreement on a set of proposed changes. What -- the work that remains is to agree on a process forward, how are we going to move forward? It is our view institutionally that we need to put the changes out for comment for some period of time so that the public, all members of the public who want to comment can see them again and comment on them again and see -- see them in the context of the quantitative impact survey that we did.

And that that's the right way to proceed. That's how we would ordinarily proceed. And we don't see why we would deviate from that. And this is -- this is the conversation we're now having with the leadership of the FDIC and the OCC. And my hope is that we'll be able to come together around a way to proceed forward, you know, very soon.

I had hoped we would have done so by now, but I believe we will do so fairly soon.


STEVE DAINES:
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.


SHERROD BROWN:
Thank you for joining us today, Chair Powell. I look forward to working with you to strengthen this economy. For senators who wish to submit questions for the hearing record, they're due one week from today, July 16th. To Chair Powell, please submit your responses to questions for the record 45 days -- no more than 45 days from the day you receive them.

Thank you for your testimony. The committee is adjourned.

上院銀行・住宅・都市問題委員会、半期金融政策報告に関する公聴会を開催
パネル・メンバーおよび参考人リスト

シェロッド・ブラウン
上院銀行・住宅・都市問題委員会を開会します。パウエル委員長、ようこそ。お戻りできて光栄です。この時期にお会いできて光栄です オハイオ市民は知っています アメリカ人は知っています 我々の経済は根本的に 公平な土俵ではありません その代わりに、ダビデとゴリアテの経済があり、そこでは大企業が権力を行使して、経済の利益をすべてトップに流しています。

ここにいる多くの人々に助けられ、幇助されながら、企業はアメリカ人の懐と労働者の給料から最後の一銭まで搾り取る。もはや隠そうともしない。大企業は、より少ない金額でより多くの金額を請求している。アメリカ人は不満を募らせている。いや、アメリカ人は怒っているのだ。選択肢がどんどん減っているのだ。

そして、その選択肢はますます高くつく。物価を抑えることはFRBの使命の一部である。しかし、私たちの多くが明らかにしているように、インフレに対抗するためのFRBの主な手段である金利引き上げは、物価上昇の最大の原因である企業の貪欲さには何も対処していない。金利が高すぎる状態が長く続くと、労働者の給料が脅かされる一方で、他のコスト、特に住宅費が高く維持される。

住宅価格と家賃は上がり続けている。FRBが利上げを始めて以来、家族が住宅ローンを組むのに必要な所得がほぼ倍増したのは当然だ。持ち家は長い間、中産階級の基盤であったが、今日、住宅を購入できる中産階級の家庭はますます少なくなっている。

金利上昇は、わが国の住宅供給不足を改善するどころか、悪化させている。私たちはあらゆる種類の住宅建設を増やす必要がある。金利上昇はその逆を招き、特に多世帯住宅の建設は財政的に難しくなる。金利の上昇は、住宅ローンであれ車であれ、その他何であれ、勤労者世帯にとって借入をより高価なものにする。

ほとんどの人は、すべてを現金で支払う余裕などない。そして、物価の上昇によって家計が圧迫されていると感じている何百万人ものアメリカ人にとって、食料品やその他の必需品の支払いのためにクレジットカードで借金をすることは、最後の手段となっている。しかし、借金の返済に苦しむ人が増えるにつれ、クレジットカードの金利は史上最高水準に達している。

先月、チョプラ局長はこの委員会で証言し、クレジットカード発行会社がコストをカバーするために必要な金利をはるかに超えて高い金利を請求していることを明言した。銀行は資金繰りに苦しむアメリカ人を犠牲にして、記録的な利益を上げている。議長、FRBが毎月金利を高く維持すればするほど、家を買うにも金を借りるにもコストがかかり、アメリカ人は損をするのです。

借入コストの上昇は将来の経済成長を阻害し、住宅建設数の減少につながり、企業による経済への投資の減少につながり、最終的にはFRBが止めなければ労働者の失業につながる。FRBが経済政策を決定する際、私はFRBにこれらのトレードオフを考慮し、誰の雇用と未来が危機に瀕しているのかを忘れないよう強く求めたい。

そのために、私は同僚とともに企業の責任を追及してきたし、これからもそうしていくつもりだ。例えば、私たちは高齢者向けのインシュリン価格に上限を設けるために闘ってきた。私たちは、この価格上限--救命薬に対する価格上限--をすべてのアメリカ人のために拡大するために闘い続け、この委員会の同僚と私が取り組んでいる理由--それは、私たちがより多くのアメリカ人のために住宅費の引き下げに取り組んでいる理由でもある。

FRBはまた、銀行システムを安定させ、消費者の資金の安全を確保するための活動を続けている。昨年、FRBと他の銀行規制当局は、銀行の自己資本規制を更新する案を発表した。この委員会でも、強力な資本基準に対する圧倒的な支持をお聞きになったことでしょう。

強力な資本基準は経済にとって不可欠なものです。ウォール街の賭けが不調に終わった場合、それはしばしば起こることだが、納税者ではなく、投資家、経営陣、株主がその代償を払わなければならない。最大手銀行は、このFRBの提案を攻撃するために莫大な資金を費やしてきた。

しかし、FRBは大手銀行のために働いているのではない。アメリカ国民のために働いているのだ。あなた方の関心は、銀行のCEOの株式ポートフォリオを守ることではなく、アメリカ人の資金を守る資本規制を策定することであるべきだ。FRBは、このような恥知らずなロビー活動に目をつぶり、納税者の利益になるような規則を最終決定する必要がある。

銀行システムの安全性を低下させるウォール街のビジネスモデルのもうひとつの危険な部分は、インセンティブに基づく報酬である。この報酬モデルは、短期的にはウォール街の重役を富ませるが、銀行は破綻しやすくなる。私たちは2008年にこのモデルの結果を目の当たりにした。昨年もまた、シリコンバレー銀行とシグネチャーの破綻で、その結果を目の当たりにした。

他の規制当局は、こうした無謀なインセンティブを抑制するための提案を進めていますが、議長、この規則は、あなたと連邦政府が動かなければ前に進みません。このルールはとっくに期限切れです。FRBは一刻も早く、法律で定められたこの取り組みに参加しなければならない。FRBはまた、銀行間の合併・買収を審査するという重要な仕事も担っている。

過去数十年間、私たちは最大手銀行が文字通り1兆ドル規模の巨大企業に成長する一方で、オハイオ州北西部や南東部の農村地域や、それらの地域の小さな町にある何千もの小規模銀行が、それらの地域やアメリカ全土から姿を消していくのを見てきた。消費者は信頼できる地元の銀行を失った。

中小企業は長年の信頼できる銀行パートナーを失った。FRBのような規制当局には、競争を縮小・排除し、銀行の閉鎖や解雇につながる合併を防ぐという重要な仕事がある。私は最近、OCCとFDICに対し、現在の取り組みに関するコメントレターを送った。私は、FRB が合併審査プロセスを確実なものとし、消費者と地域社会を保護するために適切な措置を講じることを期待している。

最後に議長、あなたはFRBが高い倫理基準を持つようにしなければなりません。FRB職員が、FRBの金融政策や緊急プログラムに関する極秘の計画を利用して投資ポートフォリオを水増しし、その地位から利益を得るようなことがあってはならない。理事会の最新の取引規則更新は、単に十分ではない。

国民の信頼に反して投資を行った連邦準備制度理事会（FRB）職員に必要な明確な罰則を定めていない。結果が伴わない規則は、本当に規則とは言えない。米国民は、連邦準備制度理事会が自分たちのために機能していることを信頼できなければならない。

国民が連邦政府全体に対して深い皮肉を抱いている今、米国民は役人が個人的利益のためにその地位を乱用していないことを知る必要がある。議長であるあなたには、経済がウォール街のためだけでなく、すべての人のために機能するようにする重要な役割がある。FRBの地方銀行は、その12地区の人々や他の利害関係者から話を聞き、彼らのニーズを理解するために、その役割を果たさなければなりません。

私は今日、FRBがどのようにその二重の使命のバランスをとるのか、どのようにアメリカ人の資金を保護するのか、どのように労働の尊厳を守る経済を育成するのか、聞くことを楽しみにしています。スコット議員


ティム・スコットです：
議長、ありがとうございます。パウエル議長、今朝はありがとうございました。おかえりなさい。ジョー・バイデンはこの経済を壊してしまいました。それが結論だ。終わりを念頭に置いて始めたい。ジョー・バイデンは私たちの経済を壊してしまった。毎日、家庭は食卓に食べ物を並べるのに苦労している。

実質賃金の伸びは、物価上昇とインフレの暴走に食いつぶされている。ジョー・バイデンでは、52週連続で賃金がインフレ率に食われていた事実を考えてみてほしい。年12月、サウスカロライナ州のガソリンは1ガロン当たり1ドル99セントだった。今日でも1ガロンあたり3.19ドルで、わずか数年で50％も上昇している。

だから、アメリカの平均的な家庭、特に私が育ったような貧困にあえぐ片親家庭には壊滅的な打撃だ。ガソリン代が50％、食料品が30％、家の冷暖房費が25％値上がりしているのを見れば、それは大変なことではありません。それは不幸なことではない。

絶対的な危機なのだ。そして今日、アメリカではあまりに多くの世帯が給料日前の生活をしており、バイデン政権がもたらす逆風を恐れている。もちろん、逆風はインフレというプリズムを通して見られる。インフレ率がこれほど高くなったのは、ジミー・カーター政権時代以来だ。

インフレによる打撃は、家計に大きな打撃を与えている。そしてその惨状は、大多数のアメリカ人にとって現実のものとなっている。バイデン政権がFRBをバスの下に投げ捨てたり、現実の問題から目をそらしたりしているのだ。

委員会公聴会に次ぐ委員会公聴会に次ぐ委員会公聴会。左派の友人たちは、ペンシルベニア通り1600番地の真犯人以外の誰かを指したがる。この政権の進歩的な希望リスト、支出プロジェクト、統制のきかない規制は、アメリカの給料を食い潰し続けている。

そして彼らは非難し続ける。シュリンクインフレであれ、強欲インフレであれ、スキンプインフレであれ、彼らはバイデンフレ以外の誰かのせいにしようと探しているのだ。ジョー・バイデンの経済政策の惨状は、日常的なアメリカ人に影響を与え続けている。アメリカ国民は見せかけを見抜き、真の解決策を求めている。

この政権下で平均的なアメリカ人が経験していることを理解するのに、経済学博士である必要はない。バイデン大統領と民主党の同僚が何兆ドルもの資金を経済に投入したとき、その資金が需要を増やし、物価を押し上げた。単純なことだ。アメリカ国民は毎回それを見て感じている。

先ほども言ったように、食料品店やガソリンスタンド、医者でそれを目の当たりにしている。この影響は否定できない。つい先週、私たちは国の誕生を祝い、自由と解放という概念の誕生を祝った。しかし、アメリカの家庭は史上最も高価な7月4日を迎えました。今年の炊き出しの費用は、ほんの数年前に比べて平均で30％も高くなっています。


ティム・スコット
私はそれをでたらめと呼ぶ。さらに悪いのは、この政権が経済学の教訓を学ぼうとしていないことだ。支出を増やし、規制を強化しようとする動きを抑えるどころか、単に規制を強化するだけだ。例えば、何百億ドルにものぼる学生ローンの免除や、その決定の合憲性に関係なくさらに免除する新たな計画などだ。では、この何十億ドルもの免除は、実際には誰のために行われているのか？答えは簡単だ。この免除制度は、平均所得30万ドル以上の世帯の75万人の債務救済につながる。

そして、アメリカの平均的な家庭の世帯収入が約74,000ドルであるという事実を忘れてはならない。つまり、この違憲の学生ローン免除は、一世帯あたり74,000ドルの中央値世帯に、30万ドル以上の世帯に住む学生の債務免除の負担を求めるものなのだ。これにかかる実際の費用は？

8,700億ドルから1兆4,000億ドルです。では、なぜ私は......なぜ私はこのような質問をしなければならないのでしょうか？なぜ私たちは、30万ドルを超える学生ローンの負債を抱えた世帯を救済するための新たな計画で、給料日前に苦しい思いをしているアメリカの家庭を罰し続けるのでしょうか？答えは簡単だ。政治だ。

11月の選挙に向けて次々と票を買うための一つの方法だ。ただ、想像するのは難しい。FRBがインフレを抑制するために行っていることを概説するあなたの慎重な言葉には感謝しているが、何が本当に起こっているのか、左派の政治的迎合であることを認識するのは、もう過去のことだと思う。私たちの経済は、これ以上の無駄遣いを処理できないと私は強く信じている。

もし異論があれば、ぜひご意見をお聞かせいただきたい。しかし、成長を阻害するのは支出政策だけではない。過剰な規制もある。過剰規制の例として、バーゼルIIIの最終段階を通じた傍観者的な資本駐留ほど適切なものはないだろう。この提案自体、何百万人ものアメリカ人が家を持ち、中小企業を立ち上げ、アメリカンドリームを実現するために必要なクレジットや資本を利用する機会を失うことになる。

今日、C-Spanでこの公聴会を実際に見ている人たちにとって、バーゼルIIIの資本要件は、スタークォーターバック、ダク・プレスコットを連れて行き、シーズン中に怪我をするかもしれないから傍観していろと言うようなものだ。実に馬鹿げている。しかし、この資本要件案はまさにそうであり、地球上で最も偉大な経済の傍観者に多くの資金を強制し、初めて住宅を購入する人々や事業主、アメリカンドリームを実現しようとする人々の手から資金を奪うことになる。

利害関係が大きいからこそ、私たちはこの問題をきちんと解決しなければならないのです。何度も申し上げていることですが、繰り返しになります。この異常な提案には明確な正当性の形が欠けている。パウエル委員長、あなた、あなたの同僚知事、そしてこのルール作りに加わっている他の機関は、法律に従い、宿題をこなし、そして国民にチェックさせることが不可欠です。

だからこそ私は、バーゼルIIIの最終案について完全な再提案を行うことが絶対に必要だと考えている。利害関係者にそれを見てもらい、今後何が必要かを再調整する機会を与えるのです。量的に正当化されない資本増強は、それを最も必要とする米国民に損害を与える。

農家、住宅購入者、中小企業経営者は、信用へのアクセスを必要としており、それに値する。従って、もう一度繰り返す。この規則制定プロセスに対する信頼を回復し、既存の提案を撤回し、完全にやり直す必要がある。そして、データが分析され、国民の精査に供されるようになったら、APP--APA--の要件に従って、適切な規則案を再発行してください。あなたの冒頭陳述と、その後の対話の機会を楽しみにしています。


シェロッド・ブラウン
スコット議員、ありがとうございます。議長、ようこそ。本日の証言に感謝いたします。続けてください。


ジェローム・パウエル：
ブラウン議長、スコット議員、その他委員の皆様、連邦準備制度理事会（FRB）の半期金融政策報告書を提出する機会をいただき感謝いたします。米連邦準備制度理事会（FRB）は、米国民の利益のために最大限の雇用と安定した物価を促進するという、我々の二重の使命に引き続き焦点を合わせている。

過去2年間、経済はFRBが目標とする2％のインフレ率に向けてかなり前進し、労働市場の状況は堅調を維持しながらも冷え込んでいる。こうした動きを反映して、雇用とインフレの目標達成に向けたリスクは、より良いバランスになりつつある。金融政策に話を移す前に、現在の経済状況を振り返っておこう。

最近の指標は、米国経済が引き続き堅調なペースで拡大していることを示唆している。国内総生産の伸びは、昨年後半の目覚しい力強さに続き、今年前半は緩やかになっているようだ。しかし、個人消費の伸びは鈍化しているものの堅調で、民間内需は引き続き堅調である。

設備投資も緩やかな伸びを示し、住宅投資も持ち直しつつある。供給環境の改善が、昨年来の底堅い需要と米国経済の好調を支えてきた。労働市場では、広範な指標から、状況はパンデミック前夜とほぼ同じ水準に戻ったことが示唆される。

失業率は上昇に転じたが、6月時点でも4.1％と低水準にある。今年上半期の雇用者数は月平均22万2,000人増加した。ここ数年の力強い雇用創出は、25歳から54歳までの労働力人口の増加、いわゆる働き盛りの労働者の増加、そして移民の増加ペースを反映した労働者供給の増加を伴っている。

その結果、雇用と労働者の格差はピーク時から大幅に縮小し、現在は2019年の大流行前の水準を少し上回る程度である。名目賃金の伸びはこの1年で緩やかになった。堅調な労働市場により、雇用と所得における長年の各層間格差が縮小している。インフレ率は過去2〜3年で顕著に緩和したが、連邦公開市場委員会（FOMC）の長期目標である2％を依然上回っている。

個人消費支出は5月までの12ヵ月間に2.6%上昇した。変動の激しい食品とエネルギーのカテゴリーを除いたコアPCE価格も2.6%上昇した。今年初めのインフレ目標2%に向けた進展は乏しかったが、最近の月次指標は緩やかな進展を示している。

長期的なインフレ期待は、家計、企業、予測担当者を対象とした広範な調査や金融市場の指標に反映されているように、依然として十分に固定されているようだ。我々の金融政策行動は、米国民のために最大限の雇用と安定した物価を促進するという、我々の二重の使命に導かれている。

これらの目標を支持するため、委員会は昨年7月以来、フェデラルファンド金利の目標レンジを5.25～5.5%に維持してきた。また、保有有価証券の削減も続けてきた。5月の会合では、6月からバランスシートの縮小ペースを減速させることを決定したが、これは以前に発表された計画と一致している。

制限的な金融政策スタンスは、需要と供給の状況をより良いバランスに導き、インフレに下方圧力をかけるのに役立っている。当委員会は、インフレ率が持続的に2％に向かっているという確信が得られるまで、フェデラルファンド金利の目標レンジを引き下げることは適切ではないと考えている。

今年第1四半期のデータは、そのような自信を裏付けるものではなかった。しかし、直近のインフレ指標は緩やかな進展を示しており、インフレ率が持続的に2%に向かっているという確信がさらに強まるだろう。我々は引き続き、会合ごとに意思決定を行っていく。

私たちは、政策抑制を早急に、あるいは過度に縮小すれば、インフレ率に関するこれまでの進展を停滞させ、あるいは逆行させる可能性があることを知っています。同時に、過去2年間、インフレ率の低下と労働市場の冷え込みの両面で達成した進展を考慮すれば、インフレ率の上昇だけが私たちが直面しているリスクではありません。

政策抑制の縮小が遅すぎたり少なすぎたりすれば、経済活動や雇用を不当に弱める可能性がある。フェデラル・ファンド・レート目標レンジの調整を検討する際、委員会は、今後発表されるデータと、それが見通しの進展、リスクのバランス、金融政策の適切な道筋に与える影響を注意深く評価するという慣行を継続する。

議会は連邦準備制度理事会（FRB）に、最大限の雇用と物価の安定という2つのマンデートを追求する上で長期的な視野に立つために必要な、運営上の独立性を託している。我々は、インフレ率を2％の目標まで低下させ、長期的なインフレ期待を適切に維持することに引き続き取り組んでいる。

物価安定の回復は、最大限の雇用と長期的な物価安定の達成に不可欠である。こうした目標を達成するための我々の成功は、すべてのアメリカ国民にとって重要である。最後に、私たちの行動が全米の地域社会、家族、ビジネスに影響を与えることを理解していることを強調します。私たちの行動はすべて、公的使命のためにあるのです。

ありがとうございました。質問をお待ちしています。


シェロッド・ブラウン：
委員長、ありがとうございました。では、先輩のリード議員から質問を始めます。


ジャック・リード：
委員長、どうもありがとうございます。トランプ前大統領は、当選すれば10％から60％の大幅な関税引き上げを提案し、それによって連邦所得税を撤廃するとの意向を示しています。まず、関税引き上げが物価や消費者、経済に与える影響についてお聞かせください。


ジェローム・パウエル
リード議員、ありがとうございます。私は......私は......ですから、選挙運動的な情報についてはコメントしないことにしています。そのようなことはしない。また、貿易政策についてもコメントしません。私たちには本当に具体的で重要な仕事があり、それだけに専念するようにしています。


ジャック・リード
まあ、その原則を前もって確立させておいてよかったと思います。しかし、少し意見を言わせてください。関税の10％引き上げは、店頭での価格に影響を与えるでしょう。おそらく価格に転嫁されるからだ。60パーセントの関税引き上げは大きい。実際、所得税に取って代わるには、所得税の損失を補うために関税を70％引き上げる必要があると聞いています。

あなたの公平性と中立性には敬意を表しますが、この数字がこの国を救うことにつながるとは思えません。では、もっとあなたの答えに近い話に切り替えさせてください。あなたは冒頭の発言で、労働市場はより良いバランスにあるように見え、それが金利引き上げの可否を判断する重要な要素のひとつであると述べた。

私は、FRBが金利引き下げにあまり早く踏み切っていないことを少し懸念しています。それについてコメントいただけますか、議長？


ジェローム・パウエル
直近の労働市場のデータは、ご指摘の通り、労働市場の状況が2年前に比べてかなり冷え込んでいるというかなり明確なシグナルを送っています。これはもはや過熱した経済ではありません。冒頭の挨拶で述べたように、この経済は、ほとんどの指標から見て、パンデミック以前の状態にほぼ戻っている。

そして、それは力強い労働市場であったが、過熱した労働市場ではなかった。その結果、私たちは両面のリスクに直面していることをよく認識していますし、これまでもそうでした。しかし今、労働市場は完全にバランスを取り戻しているように見えます。私たちは、私たちがあまりに早く動きすぎると、不必要に経済活動を阻害し、継続的な景気拡大を妨げる可能性があることを知っています。

あまりにゆっくりとした動きでは、せっかくの成果を台無しにしてしまうかもしれない。政策を緩めるのが遅すぎたり少なすぎたりすれば、経済活動に悪影響を及ぼす可能性がある。政策緩和が遅すぎたり、早すぎたりすれば、インフレ率の改善を台無しにしかねない。

ですから、私たちはこの2つのリスクのバランスを非常に重視しています。それこそが、最近私たちが考えていることの本質なのです。


ジャック・リード
しかし、いずれ金利を引き下げる方向に向かっているようです。それは方向性というより、むしろ願望かもしれない。


ジェローム・パウエル
そうですね、経済予測の最後のまとめを見ていただければわかると思いますが、このように言えると思います。次の政策が利上げになるとは思えない。そのような可能性がないとは言い切れませんが、そのような方向性はないと思われます。インフレがさらに進展し、労働市場が堅調を維持すれば、適切なタイミングで政策を緩和し始めるという方向性がありそうです。


ジャック・リード
ありがとうございます。ちょうど2週間前、連邦準備制度理事会（FRB）を含むすべての連邦規制当局に影響を与える2つの判決が最高裁で下されました。連邦準備制度理事会（FRB）を含むすべての連邦規制当局に影響を与えるものです。何十年もの間、当局の意思決定に対する司法の判断を排除してきたシェブロン事件を覆しました。また、行政手続法の時効を大幅に延長した。これらの決定が連邦準備制度理事会（FRB）に与える累積的な影響について、どのようにお考えですか？

もっと広く言えば、FRBが下す事実上あらゆる規制上の決定が裁判官によって二の足を踏まれる可能性があるとすれば、それは経済にとってどのような意味を持つのでしょうか。あなたは今どのような立場にありますか？


ジェローム・パウエル
ですから、私たちは組織として、法律の実際の文言と意図を読み、それに注意深く従うことに非常に重点を置いています。これは私たちが持つ強力な組織的価値です。これらの判決は下されたばかりの新しいもので、私たちは現在、いくつかの判決を研究しているところです。もちろん、最高裁が読み上げた法律に従うのが私たちの仕事ですから。


ジャック・リード
ありがとうございます。しかし、分析を行い、それが米国の銀行業界を規制する上で不利になるのであれば、それを公表する義務があると思います。ありがとうございました。


シェロッド・ブラウン
リード議員、ありがとうございました。サウスカロライナ州のスコット議員です。


ティム・スコット
議長、ありがとうございます。パウエル議長、バーゼル3最終案に変更が加えられるとの報道が相次いでいます。一部の報道では、早ければ8月にも最終決定される可能性があると言われています。また、修正案のタームシートを配布しているとの情報もある。

この提案は、大手から地域金融機関、米国に拠点を置く外国金融機関に至るまで、わが国の銀行システムに甚大な影響を及ぼすだけでなく、消費者のクレジット・アクセスを阻害することになります。ですから、あなた自身が、広範かつ重大な変更があると述べているとしても、私は、この提案は、プロセスにおいても実質においても欠陥があり、撤回されるべきであると考えます。

同意しますか？また、既存の提案を撤回し、しっかりとした通知とコメントのプロセスを経て新たな提案を出すことを約束しますか？


ジェローム・パウエル
では、すべての状況についてご報告します。


ティム・スコット：
お願いします。


ジェローム・パウエルです：
この数カ月間、バー監督担当副委員長は他の銀行規制当局と、原案に対する変更の可能性をめぐって話し合いを重ねてきました。その結果、かなり進展があり、変更の内容で合意できるところまで来ています。

すべてが合意されるまでは何も合意されませんので、具体的なことは申し上げられません。私たちが進歩を遂げようとしているのは、プロセスの問題です。私の考えでもあり、理事会のメンバーも強く支持していることですが、改訂案をある程度の期間、コメント募集にかける必要があると考えています。

その理由は、広範かつ重大な変更がある場合、それが私たちの慣行だからです。その慣行から逸脱する理由は見当たらない。それは、過去の慣行や行政手続法に合致していると思われる。FDICとOCCは、この問題についてはまだ合意に至っていない。まだ合意には至っていませんが、合意できるものと期待しています。

まだ合意には至っていませんが、合意できることを大いに期待しています。


ティム・スコット：
わかりました。では、あなたの回答の大部分に感謝します。別の話題に移る前に、バーゼルについてもうひとつ議論したいことがあります。私は、この提案やプロセスが密室で行われているように見えることが非常に気になります。FRB、FDIC、OCCは昨年7月にバーゼル3の最終案を提示した。

そして10月、FRBはバーゼル3のコストに関する定量的影響調査を行うためのデータ収集を開始した。今年1月に入り、バー副議長は、調査結果が公表され次第、パブリック・コメントを実施することを約束した。

我々はまだその結果を待っている。その一方で、FRBは提案の修正に取り組んでおり、最新版に移行しているという噂を耳にしている。FRBがパブリック・コメントを受ける前に、資本案をどのように修正したり再発行したりするのか、基本的に私の疑問なのですが、どうかご理解ください。


ジェローム・パウエル
ご承知の通り、FRBは広範なパブリック・コメントを受領しており、ご指摘の定量的影響調査も評価しています。ですから、他の機関と完全に合意に達したら、変更案と定量的影響調査を公表し、QISが示唆する変更がもたらす影響も公表するということです。

そうして、一定期間コメント募集を行い、再度コメントを得た後、最終決定へと進むことができる。これが基本的な大まかな流れです。


ティム・スコット
パブリックコメントの期間はどれくらいですか？


ジェローム・パウエル：
それは有意義なものでしょう。つまり、60日間かもしれません。長くする必要はない。しかし、その前に、実際に修正案を発表するまでに多くの作業が必要で、かなりの労力がかかる。そして、それを公表し、60日間のコメント期間を経て、またコメントをもらい、そのコメントを評価する期間が設けられる。

それで初めて最終決定となる。


ティム・スコット：
そうですね。ありがとうございます。さて、もう時間がないので最後に1点だけ。リード上院議員がシェブロン事件とその影響についてコメントされました。経済に影響を与えるような新しい規制については、費用便益分析が必要であり、これは非常に有益だと思います。

バーゼル3の何千ページ、何千ページにも及ぶ文書の中で、費用便益分析のアプローチが反映されていたのは20ページほどだったと思います。今後もこのような取り組みが増えることを期待しています。


ジェローム・パウエル：
ありがとうございました。


テスター上院議員です：
モンタナ州のテスター上院議員です。


テスターです
ありがとうございます パウエル議長、ご丁寧にありがとうございます。今日はお会いできてうれしいです。あなたの仕事に感謝します。モンタナ州のどこに行っても、ビリングスだろうがビュートだろうがボーズマンだろうがバスビーだろうがビッグサンディだろうが、住宅は大きな問題です。大きな町でも、中規模の町でも、小さな町でもです。

住宅は大きな問題であり、国全体が抱えている問題だと思います。住宅問題は、あなたが見ている全体的な経済状況の中でどのように位置づけられるのでしょうか？


ジェローム・パウエル
パンデミック以前から住宅問題はありました。確かに、パンデミックは新たな歪みを生み出し、金融政策は利子に敏感な支出を通じて機能している。家を買い、住宅ローンを組むことほど、利子に敏感な支出はない。

ですから、金融引き締め政策が住宅セクターの経済活動に影響を及ぼしていることは確かですが、同時に、私たちが住宅に対してできる最善のことは、インフレ率を持続可能なベースで2％まで下げることに成功することです。


ジョン・テスター
もう少し掘り下げてみましょう。私は必ずしも住宅コストに関心があるわけではありません。中小企業、学校、病院、メインストリートのビジネスなど、人を雇えないところはたくさんあります。

彼らの住む場所がないため、事業を拡大することができないのです。それはあなたの経済見通しの指標にどのように適合しますか？少なくとも私の視点では、事業拡大の機会を制限していると思います。起業家、事業立ち上げの機会を制限しているわけですが、それはあなたの見る経済見通しに合致するのでしょうか？


ジェローム・パウエル
私たちの使命は物価の安定と最大限の雇用です。繰り返しになりますが、住宅供給のために私たちができる最善のことは、インフレを抑制して金利を下げ、より正常な金利設定と住宅制度を実現することだと思います。しかし、住宅供給を増やす政策はFRBの手には負えない。

州議会や連邦議会の手に委ねられているのです。


ジョン・テスター
では、もし私たちが何らかの住宅優遇策を打ち出すとしたら、それがどのようなものであれ、もしそのような優遇策によって手頃な労働力住宅が市場に出回るようになれば、経済にプラスの影響をもたらすとお考えですか？


ジェローム・パウエル
住宅が不足していることは承知していますし、多くの労働者にとって住宅は必要不可欠なものです。しかし、財政政策やその優先順位をどうするかについては、私たちが決めることではありません。


ジョン・テスター
FRBの独立性について少しお話ししたいのですが、あなたも私と同じように独立性を強く支持しておられることは存じています。中央銀行の独立性がなぜ決定的に重要なのか、少なくともあなたの見解をお聞かせください。


ジェローム・パウエル
ありがとうございます。喜んで。基本的にすべての先進国は、中央銀行の銀行業務、つまり業務上の独立性という政策を採用しています。私たちは、余計な要因（そのひとつが政治的な要因であろう）を考慮することなく意思決定を行うよう指示されています。

私たちは、定期的に行っているように、これは国としての制度的な選択であり、それが国民に役立つと見なされる限り、それは良い選択であることを強調したいだけです。


ジョン・テスター
わかりました。先進国経済について、この国の経済はあまり良い状態ではないと言う人もいます。あなたの視点から、中央銀行を持つ他の先進国と比べて、この国の経済がどうなっているのか教えてください。


ジェローム・パウエル
私は仕事柄、国際的な議論に参加することが多いのですが、この2年間、アメリカ経済のパフォーマンスがいかに並外れているかということが話題になりました。アメリカ経済は、先進国経済の仲間たちと比べても、非常に好調であることは明らかです。


ジョン・テスター
世界のどの国、どの中央銀行、どの先進国も、これ以上のパフォーマンスを示していますか？


ジェローム・パウエル
中央銀行として？


ジョン・テスター：いいえ：
いいえ、先進国で中央銀行が私たちよりもうまく機能している国はありません。


ジェローム・パウエル：
思い浮かびませんね。メジャーのことを考えると、答えはノーでしょう。


ジョン・テスター：
わかりました。ありがとう。


シェロッド・ブラウン：
ありがとう、テスター上院議員。サウスダコタのラウンズ上院議員です。


マイク・ラウンズ：
ありがとうございます、議長。議長、まず、再度のご訪問、ありがとうございます。まず、バーゼル3の最終的な議論から始めたいと思います。スコット上院議員は、私たちの多くが抱いているバーゼル3への懸念を見事に整理してくれたと思います。バーゼル3の最終的な議論から始めたいと思います。

技術的なことですが、具体的な質問をさせてください。あなたもバー副委員長も、提案にあるすべてのリスクタイプに重要な変更があることを確認しています。大幅な変更がある以上、各機関が現在着地しているところは、昨夏の最初の提案から論理的に発展したものだとお考えですか？


ジェローム・パウエル
ご存じない方のために説明しますと、論理的な発展かどうかが法的なテストになります。論理的な発展でなければ、法的には再提案が必要になる。私は法的な判断を下すつもりはありません。ただ、私の立場、私の見解、そして理事会の同僚の何人かが強く抱いている見解から言わせてもらえば、正しいことだからという理由で、コメント募集のために再度変更案を提出するのは適切なことだと思います。規則案に重要な変更がある場合、通常私たちが行うことです。


MIKE ROUNDS：
理事会のコンセンサスは得られていますか？


ジェローム・パウエル：
もちろん、FDICとOCCには、その必要性を満たすようなものに取り組むよう協議しており、その合意を得なければなりません。


MIKE ROUNDS：
そのようにお考えなのですね。


ジェローム・パウエル：
そうです。


そうです：
もしそうだとすると、バーゼル3の最終的な決定や提言が最終決定となるのは、おそらく来年になるのではないでしょうか？


ジェローム・パウエル
そうかもしれない。そうかもしれませんね。ええ、正確には言えませんが。我々はそれを出すだろう。これを書き上げるには時間がかかる。それからコメントを募集し、コメントを得て、コメントを読み、最終規則を書く。来年初めが目安になるでしょう。


MIKE ROUNDS：
なぜ私がプッシュするかというと、この件に直接関わっている人が非常に多く、この国の経済や多くの金融機関に与える影響が大きいからです。ですから、できる限り深く掘り下げていただきたいと思います。

また、もう1つの分野にも触れたいと思います。これは、以前このグループの前であなたと私が話し合ったことです。しかし、インフレにはどのような部分があり、FRBとしてコントロールできる部分とできない部分があるのかについてお話ししたいと思います。インフレに関する方程式の需要サイドは、あなた方が使えるツールを持っている部分ですが、供給サイドはまだそこにあります。



MIKE ROUNDS：
というのも、このような場で話をすると、自然と政治的な話になってしまうからです。そして、このようなことをやっていく中で、私が抱いている懸念を共有したいと思います。そして、あなたが政治的なことを言いたがらないことは承知していますが、このことを整理した上で、あなたが持っているプロセスを通じてインフレに変化をもたらすことに関して、あなたがコントロールできることとコントロールできないことについてお話したいと思います。

バイデン大統領が就任したとき、ガソリン価格は......バイデン大統領が就任して以来、ガソリン価格は54％以上上昇しました。エネルギー価格は41％上昇しました。燃料油価格は37％上昇しました。私が言いたいことは、エネルギー価格が大幅に上昇しているということです。

その理由のひとつは、パンデミックからの脱却に伴う追加需要だと思いますが、もうひとつは、大統領が就任当日にキーストーンXLパイプラインのキャンセルを決定したことで、投資家が伝統的なエネルギー資源への投資を本当に再開したいのかどうかということです。

大統領は就任当日にキーストーンXLパイプラインのキャンセルを決断し、投資家たちに伝統的なエネルギーや米国での伝統的なエネルギーへの投資、そして数十億ドル規模の契約がペンの一筆でキャンセルされるという事実について、とんでもないメッセージを送った。さて、あなたにお聞きしたいのは、多くの製品の価格が20％以上上昇したインフレのうち、何％、あるいは何％上昇したのか、あるいは何％上昇したのか、あるいは何％上昇したのかについて議論されたことはありますか？


ジェローム・パウエル
それは私たちが何度も考えてきたことであり、正確な数字に落とし込もうとする試みは、非常に不確かなものであるため、不適切なものでしょう。しかし、私たちが強く信じているのは、かなりの需要要素があり、かなりの供給要素があるということだ。それがインフレ率の低下に寄与していることは明らかです。

また、例えば労働市場では需要が冷え込んでいる。つまり、2つの力が一緒に働いているのです。この2つの力を分解することはできません。不正確な見積もりです。何とも言えません。


MIKE ROUNDS：
ただ単に、需要も供給も両方あるということを認めているだけです。両方です。間違いなく両方です。両方です。そうですね。ありがとうございます。ありがとうございました。時間切れです。


シェロッド・ブラウン：
ありがとう ラウンズ議員 パウエル議長、失業率はこの1年で半ポイント上昇しました。求人数は50％近く減少しています。採用率も退職率もパンデミック以前の水準を下回っている。FRBが金利引き下げを長引かせれば、高賃金の雇用創出というこれまでの前進が台無しになりかねないと懸念している。

完全雇用はFRBの使命の一部です。労働市場における金利上昇のリスクをどのように評価していますか？


ジェローム・パウエル
ですから、労働市場がかなり冷え込んでいることを最新のデータが示しているというあなたのご指摘には完全に同意します。私たちは、より良いインフレ・データを望んでいますし、力強い労働市場も引き続き望んでいます。

そして、この2つは法の下では平等です。しかし、それが私たちの仕事であることを強く自覚し、それを実行しようとしています。


シェロッド・ブラウン：
失業率が上昇傾向にあるのなら、アメリカ人の雇用を守るために直ちに行動しなければならない。FRBがインフレ目標をオーバーシュートし、まったく不必要な景気後退を引き起こせば、労働者は失うものが多すぎる。何度でも何度でも言う。それはご理解いただけたと思います 住宅。

金利上昇は住宅をより手の届かないものにしている。金利が上がればコストが下がるはずなのに、住宅価格は高騰し続けている。金利を高く維持することで、FRBは何百万人ものアメリカ人が生活と出世に苦しんでいるという経済的現実を無視している。イエスかノーで答えられる質問を3つさせてほしい。

FRBが利上げを始めた2022年後半以降、住宅販売量は減少していますか？


ジェローム・パウエル
そうだと思います。


シェロッド・ブラウン
2022年後半以降、住宅価格の中央値は上昇しましたか？


ジェローム・パウエル：
そうだと思います。


そうだと思います：
2022年後半以降、住宅購入者にとって毎月の住宅ローン返済額は手頃になりましたか、それとも手ごろではなくなりましたか？


ジェローム・パウエル：そうです：
手ごろではなくなりました。


そうですか：
わかりました。ありがとうございます。要するに、住宅販売が減少しているにもかかわらず、一戸建て住宅の中央価格は20,000ドル近く上昇している。人々は住宅ローンの支払いに収入の多くを費やしている。ですから、金利が上がっても、あなたの回答やデータを見れば、金利が上がっても住宅コストが下がらないのは明らかです。

住宅取得のコストは上がる一方なのです。シナプスの倒産に話を移そう。5月中旬以降、このフィンテック中間業者の倒産により、オハイオ州民を含む何万人もの人々が資金へのアクセスを失っている。報道によれば、9,500万ドルもの資金が紛失した可能性があるという。

FRBはシナプスの元パートナー銀行の一つであるエボルブ銀行を監督しており、規制当局としての信頼は、銀行がサービスを提供する人々を守ることを確認するあなたの仕事です。FRBはシナプス破綻の影響を受けた顧客を支援するために何をしているのですか？資金へのアクセスを回復させるために何をしていますか？


ジェローム・パウエル
私たちは銀行を監督しています。私たちはシナプスを監督しているわけではありませんし、シナプスにつながるフィンテック企業を監督しているわけでもありません。また、ご存じかもしれませんが、今回のような事態が起こる前に、私たちはエボラブル社に対して強制執行を行いました。


シェロッド・ブラウン
わかりました。消費者を一刻も早く救済することが重要です。その点については、引き続きお話を伺います。私たちは注視しています。FRBは監督権限を行使して、エボラブルが口座保有者に資金を返還するために必要なリソースを投入していることを確認する必要がある。

最後のコメントとして、もうひとつ書いておきたいことがある。シリコンバレー銀行の破綻に関する昨年のFRBの報告書では、インセンティブに基づく報酬がいかに過剰なリスクテイクを促し、それが同銀行の破綻につながったかが指摘されている。シリコンバレー銀行のCEOたちがこの委員会で証言したのを、皆さんはご覧になったか、あるいは報告書をご覧になったことだろう。

報告書では、銀行の破綻を招いたインセンティブ報酬について、SVBの経営陣が健全なリスク管理よりも短期的な利益を重視する金銭的インセンティブを持っていたと述べている。スミス上院議員、バトラー上院議員、ワーナー上院議員、そして私も、健全なリスク管理よりも短期的な利益を重視することが金融システムに重大な問題を引き起こすと、何度も何度も申し上げてきた。

健全なリスク管理よりも短期的な利益追求が金融システムに重大な問題を引き起こしているのだ。私は、役員報酬に関する長年の懸案であったルール作りに、同僚議員とともに速やかに着手することを強く求めます。ご存知のように、役員報酬がどんどん上がり続けていることは、世間を騒がせています。あなたには、それに対処する重要な役割、法的役割があります。

ありがとうございました。ティリス上院議員の登場です。


トム・ティリス
ありがとうございます 議長 議長、お集まりいただきありがとうございます。バーゼルIIIの終盤戦について手短にお話ししたいと思います。QISの結果を公表することについて、議長から確約を得ることはできますか？


ジェローム・パウエル：
そうですね。QISの結果を公表する予定です。


トム・ティリス：
いつまでに？


ジェローム・パウエル：
まず、他の銀行機関との合意を得なければなりませんが、できるだけ早くです。


しかし、できるだけ早くです：
他の銀行機関がそれを公表することに懸念を抱いているのか、それとも単に形式的な問題なのか。


ジェローム・パウエル
まったくありません。ただ、バーゼルIIIの改正について合意を得ること、また、どのように進めていくかという大局的な問題です。


トム・ティリス
それは素晴らしいことです。皆さんからいただいたご意見には本当に感謝しています。まずは、委員会以外の場での議論や、継続的なアクセスについて、改めてお礼を申し上げるべきでした。とても生産的で、感謝しています。そして、FRBにおけるあなたのリーダーシップ。私は70年代に育ち、1973年に12歳で社会保障番号を取得しました。

そのとき初めて支払いを受けた。だから、若い頃から経済を見てきたし、社会人になるには本当にひどい時代だった。今、FRBメンバーの何人かが、金利を下げなければならない、失業率はコントロールできない、と議論しているのを聞いています。

つまり、私たちは私の同僚たちからの提案や、70年代にはあまり効果的でなかった脚本を参考にしているように聞こえるのです。しかし、一貫して高いアンインフレが続いていたときに下された決断のいくつかを事後的に振り返ってみると、私たちは一貫して高いインフレに見舞われていた。

失業率も常に高かった。そこで私たちはどのような教訓を得ることができるのだろうか。そして私は、これが挑戦の指紋であることを知っている。しかし、高失業率と高インフレに対処していた当時の、間違いなく間違った決断から何を学ぶことができるでしょうか？

私たちは何を学んだのでしょうか？


ジェローム・パウエル
私たちが学んだことの第一は、中央銀行がそれを引き受け、やり遂げるまでやり抜くことだと思います。今となっては議論の余地はありませんが、当時は実際にそうでした。しかし、当時は実際にそうだったのです。そのため、中央銀行がそれを実行に移せず、インフレが再発し続けたのです。また今回は、1分前の質問とは大きな違いがあると思います。

これは、供給サイドの非常に大きな供給ショックと、経済再開による大きな需要ショック、そして他のあらゆる出来事との組み合わせによるものです。ですから、私たちは......このような事態のひとつひとつが、それぞれのやり方で異なっているのだと思います。私たちは歴史の教訓を学ぼうとしています。


トム・ティリス
インフレ率と期待インフレ率が2％目標から乖離している場合、後ではなく今対処すべきだという意見に賛成ですか、反対ですか？


ジェローム・パウエル
もちろんです。


賛成です：
その答えはいいですね。私は違うことをしたい。今、ライトニングラウンドに入り、時間内に終わらせようとしています。私たちは2024年の銀行（米国の銀行システム）に対するストレステストの結果を見ました。あらゆる客観的指標から見て、銀行システムは強固な財務基盤にあるように私には見えます。

そう思いますか？


ジェローム・パウエル
そうだ


トム・ティリス：
最後にもう一つ、FRBはバーゼルIII案に広範かつ重要な変更を加えることを検討していますが、その件に関連して、銀行が不当に影響を受けないようにするため、FBOや特定のリージョナルにとって重要な2次的な問題を見落とさないよう強く要請してもよろしいでしょうか。今回の提案では、例えば、オペレーショナル・リスク・コストが突出して高かった。

再提案ではそのような問題に対処するつもりですか？


ジェローム・パウエル
外資系銀行、国内銀行、中小規模の銀行など、さまざまな意見があることは承知しています。このプロセスの一環として、すべての人の意見を注意深く聞くつもりです。それが私たちの義務です。


トム・ティリス：
また、ラウンズ議員の質問に対して、バー氏が予想していたものと最終的に予想されるものが異なる可能性があるため、再度コメントを募集する予定だとおっしゃいましたね。


ジェローム・パウエル
それが連邦準備制度理事会の強い見解です。私たちはFDICやOCCと協力して、そのための道筋を見つけようとしています。しかし、私たちの立場からは、それが不可欠です。


トム・ティリス：
素晴らしい。少なくとも、この壇上のこちら側にいる何人かのメンバーの強い意見だと思います。それは非常に重要なことだと思います。ありがとうございます。議長。


シェロッド・ブラウン：
ありがとう ティリス上院議員 バージニア州のワーナー上院議員です。


マーク・ウォーナー：
ありがとうございます パウエル議長、またお会いできてうれしいです。このような遅い時間になってしまいましたが、同僚議員たちがすでに発言している項目のうち、少なくとも2、3は私も発言するつもりです。まず第一に、委員長と同意見です。

私はおそらく他のどの問題よりも住宅と住宅のアフォーダビリティについてよく耳にしますが、議長に同意します。住宅ローン金利を引き下げ、住宅市場を活性化させる方法を見つけなければなりません。

また、金利引き下げ問題については議論してきたし、あなたがそれをナビゲートしなければならないことも承知しているが、遅かれ早かれそうなることを願っている。この2、3回の公聴会で私が行ったことを振り返ることはしませんが、私が得た割引窓口の提案や、あなたが取り組んでいることは知っています。

多くの同僚が量的緩和、つまりバーゼルIIIの最終的な問題について話しています。ティリス議員や他の同僚も指摘しているように、量的分析が行われることを期待したい。また、3月の書簡で私が提起した疑問のひとつに、市場リスクや信用リスクに関して、新たな規制の仕組みが既存の規制の仕組みとどのように交差しているのかを確認してほしいというものがあります。

バーゼルIIIをめぐる議論の中で、少なくとも私の理解では、皆さんは流動性基準の改定も視野に入れているのではないかと思います。流動性基準の見直しが検討されているのかどうか、またどのようなお考えをお持ちなのか、お聞かせ願えればと思います。と私は考えています。


ジェローム・パウエル：
そうですね。流動性に関する前提を更新する必要があると思いますが、これは別の提案で、私たちも取り組んでいるところです。非常に重要なことです。私たちは、このスピードの速さを目の当たりにしたと思います。それ以前よりも指数関数的に速かったのです。

それが新しい世界であり、流動性カバレッジ・レシオのようなものには、そのような世界がどのようなものであるかの推定が組み込まれているのです。


マーク・ウォーナー：
そうですね。そうではありませんでしたか？資本基準がどうであろうと、6時間以内にすべての預け金に対して0.25ドルが支払われるとしたら。


ジェローム・パウエル：
そうだ


マーク・ウォーナー：
SVBの後、インターネットを利用した経営について考える必要があるという話がたくさんありました。私たちの多くが懸念を示した。正直なところ、私は良い提案を聞いたことがありません。だから、あなた方からの提案であれ、聞いている人たちからの提案であれ、私たちはこの新しいインターネット主導の世界についてどのように考えるべきなのか。

率直に言って、SVBの大口預金者であった一部の人々の無責任な行動は、混雑した劇場で大声で火を噴くようなものであったと思います。そこで、監督改革をめぐる最後の質問になります。

GAOが、2023年の破綻の際にFRBが果たした役割について、FRBの監督手続を批判したことは知っています。全く新しい世界です。監督基準の変更は包括的なものなのでしょうか？単発的なものなのか？GAOの報告書を踏まえてどのようにお考えですか？また、昨年起きたSVBやその他のいくつかの失敗を踏まえても？


ジェローム・パウエル
バー副委員長は監督担当の副委員長であり、銀行への監督方法を検討するプロセスを主導しています。そして、かなり深く掘り下げてこれらの教訓を学び、それを適切な方法で実行しようとしている。

FRBでは現在、監督担当の副議長が中心となって、この大きなプロジェクトが進行中です。


マーク・ウォーナー
木曜日から日曜日にかけて、FRB議長やあなた方、FDICとたくさん話し合ったことを覚えています。そして、日曜の夜までにあなたたちが考え出した解決策、そして行政が考え出した解決策は、いいものだったと思います。しかし、この3、4日間はかなり恐ろしいもので、そのプロセスは、どうすれば完全に先手を打てるのか完全には分かりませんが、より明確な早期警戒システムがあり、今後このような危機的状況に陥らないようにすべきだったと私は確信しています。

繰り返しになりますが、私は、このテクノロジー・リスクと、それを正しく理解する方法についての追加的な考えを強く求めたいと思います。ありがとうございました。ありがとうございました


シェロッド・ブラウン：
ワーナー上院議員、ありがとうございました。ルイジアナ州のケネディ上院議員です。


ケネディ
ありがとうございます 議長、わが国の経済は減速していますね？


ジェローム・パウエル
はい、まだ堅調なペースで成長しています。


ジョン・ケネディ
失業率は上昇していますね？


ジェローム・パウエル：
失業率は上昇していますね？


ジョン・ケネディ
労働市場は減速していますね？


ジェローム・パウエル：
しかし、失業率は歴史的な水準から見ればまだ低いと言えるでしょう。しかし、そうです。


ジョン・ケネディ
最近の雇用統計を見ていました。あなたもご覧になったでしょう。6月に創出された新規雇用の約4分の3は、政府、医療、社会扶助の分野でした。どう思いますか？


ジェローム・パウエル：
つまり、集中しているということです。それよりも幅広い雇用創出が見たいはずです。この3つの分野は、いくつかの報告書では、今回もそうでしたが、雇用を創出する主要な分野となっています。このことは、雇用創出が経済の幅を狭めていることを物語っています。


ジョン・ケネディ
政府が雇用を創出しているということですね？


ジェローム・パウエル：
そうですね、政府です。対面サービスもある。政府によるものもある。


製造業は横ばいだ：
製造業は横ばいです。


ジェローム・パウエル：
そうですね、製造業は最近、多くの新規雇用を生み出していません。


ジョン・ケネディ
情報技術は過去2年間で雇用を減らしましたね？


ジェローム・パウエル：
わかりません。


わかりません：
レジャーとホスピタリティの雇用はほとんど減少しています。


ジェローム・パウエル：
レジャーとホスピタリティの仕事は、ほとんど微々たるものになりつつあります。


ジョン・ケネディ
つまり、私たちの経済で創出されている雇用の4分の3は、私たちの歳出赤字に直接的または間接的に関連しているのではないでしょうか？


ジェローム・パウエル：
この報告書では、医療が本当に政府の支出であるかどうかはわかりません。それは人々が消費しているものです。


ジョン・ケネディ
これらの病院はどこからお金を得ていると思いますか？


ジェローム・パウエル：
しかし、医療への支出は必ずしも財政赤字に直結しているわけではありません。


ジョン・ケネディ
私はそうは思いません。つまり、私が言いたいのはこういうことです。私たちはインフレへの期待についてよく話します。消費者の期待は、私たちが期待に譲歩する以上に、経済において大きな役割を果たしているように思います。アメリカ経済の大半は消費者主導で動いていますよね？


ジェローム・パウエル：
そうです。


そうです：
製造業主導の中国とは違いますね。


ジェローム・パウエル：
そうですね。


そうです：
あなたが経済に関する統計を挙げるのを聞きましたが、ほとんどのアメリカ人は経済について良い印象を持っていませんよね？


ジェローム・パウエル
いいえ、そして私たちは人々に経済についてどう感じるべきかを教えてはいません。


ジョン・ケネディ
つまり、バイデノミクスの定義を聞けば、ほとんどの人が「簡単だ。


ジェローム・パウエル
私なら...


JOHN KENNEDY：
それに答えたくないのですか？


ジェローム・パウエル：
その単語が含まれる文章


JOHN KENNEDY：
そうだ 私が言いたいのは......どうせあなたはそうするんだろうけど、この景気には本当に気をつけた方がいいということだ。つまり、今日、人々は良い気分にはなっていない。ヨーロッパと比べれば、中国と比べれば、カナダと比べれば、そうだろう、と説得力のある議論を展開することもできる。

しかし、感情は感情だ。人々がこの景気を良く思っていないのは、主にインフレのせいなのだ。最後の30秒を使って質問させてください。私の良き友人である議長の冒頭陳述を聞いています。インフレの原因は企業の貪欲さだと思いますか？


ジェローム・パウエル
会長が話していたことについてコメントするのは嫌なのですが。


JOHN KENNEDY：
どうぞ


ジェローム・パウエル：
FRBでは、インフレは需要と供給のバランスが崩れたときに起こると考えています。


ジョン・ケネディ
あと2秒です。では、いつ金利を引き下げるのですか？


ジェローム・パウエル：
私は、今日、将来の行動のタイミングについてシグナルを送るつもりはない。


ジョン・ケネディ
ありがとうございます、議長


シェロッド・ブラウン
ミネソタ州選出のスミス上院議員です。ありがとうございます。議長


ティナ・スミス：
ありがとうございます ようこそ、パウエル議長。またお会いできて嬉しいです。テスター上院議員が少し前に行った質問の続きです。テスター議員は、米国経済が成長率、失業率、インフレ率、インフレ抑制の面で世界の他の先進国を上回っていることについて話していました。

しかし、この経験から何を学んだとお考えですか？何が正しかったのか？また、なぜ私たちは世界の他の先進国よりもうまくいっているのでしょうか？


ジェローム・パウエル
それは、わが国経済の基本的な強さに起因していると思います。ご存知のように、欧州の経済当局者はこの問題に非常に力を入れています。欧州の経済関係者は、この問題に非常に注目しています。ヨーロッパでは40年間、生産性の向上は年率1％程度でした。私たちは2％です。

ある数字を1パーセントで計算し、それを2パーセントで計算すると、40年後の所得と生活水準の差は非常に大きくなります。彼らの疑問は、なぜそうなるのか？なぜなのか？アメリカ人が答えがちな、そして私も答えたい標準的な答えは、労働市場がより柔軟になったからだ、というものだ。

パンデミック（世界的大流行）では、人々は既存の仕事にとどまった。アメリカでは記録的な水準で転職が行われ、それが生産性を高め、生活水準の向上に寄与している。もうひとつは金融部門だ。

単に銀行があるだけでなく、アーリーステージの投資に資金を供給するエコシステムが高度に発達しています。銀行にはそのような仕組みはありません。銀行は健全な規制を受けています。革新的で柔軟な経済体である私たちは、より速く成長することができるのです。


TINA SMITH：
ありがとうございます。時々、私たちの経済をゴミのように扱ったり、私たちは最低だと言ったりする傾向があると思います。実際、私たちの経済には大きな回復力があると思います。それは、労働者の驚くべき回復力、彼らの創造性、才能、訓練、教育にも大いに関係していると私は主張したい。

また、パウエル議長に期待するわけではありませんが、連邦政府がパンデミックに対応し、人々が立ち退きを迫られることなく、たとえ働けなくとも生活費を支払えるようにしたことも、全体としてわが国の経済がパンデミックから脱却したときに生き延びることができたことを意味します。

しかし、パウエル議長にお聞きしたいのは、あなたと私がこれまで話してきたことであり、私自身も考え続けていることなのですが、この国に存在する商業用不動産のリスクについてです。特にオフィス・スペースについては、ここ数年緊張が続いていると思います。

このセクターはほぼ安定していますが、新たな債務不履行リスクがあると聞いています。私が注目しているのは、それが中小銀行に不釣り合いな形で降りかかるのではないかという予想や懸念があることです。商業銀行や地方銀行は、国内の商業用不動産ローンの3分の2を保有していると推定されます。

そのため、大規模な銀行とは異なり、こうした小規模な金融機関は、この問題に対処するのが少し難しくなるかもしれません。では、この点についてお聞かせください。このリスクをどのように見ているのか、特に、中小の銀行がより大きなプレッシャーにさらされることで、銀行部門の集中が進むという新たなリスクはないのか、少しお聞かせください。


ジェローム・パウエル
このリスクは私たちとともにあり、しばらくの間、おそらく何年も続くでしょう。銀行は、自分たちのリスクを正直に評価し、このリスクを管理するための資本や流動性、システムを備えていることを確認する必要があります。私たちが最大規模の金融機関に適用しているストレス・テストでは、商業用不動産にかなり強いストレスがかかっています。

繰り返しになりますが、結論は、大手銀行はこの問題を管理できるということです。しかし、商業用不動産に地域的に集中しがちなのは一部の中小銀行です。私たちはそうした銀行と連絡を取り合っています。監督当局や規制当局もそうした銀行と連絡を取り合い、銀行がこの問題に対処できるようにしています。

多くの銀行にとって問題になるでしょう。しかし、私たちはそれを克服しようとしていますし、私たちはそれを強く認識しています。


TINA SMITH：
ありがとうございます。私は、ミネソタ州の小さな町や大きな町にある小さな地方銀行の重要性をとても考えていますし、私の考えでは、地方銀行が独立性を保ち、地域により良いサービスを提供することがいかに重要であるかということを考えています。ですから、私はこのリスクを心配しているのです。ありがとうございました。


シェロッド・ブラウン
スミス議員、ありがとうございました。カリフォルニアのバトラー議員です。


ラフォンザ・バトラー
ありがとうございます 議長 議長、お会いできてうれしいです。


ジェローム・パウエル：
お会いできてうれしいです


ラフォンツァ・バトラー：
今日は私が最後なので 最後の5分間をすべてあなたにお願いします 最初にお話ししたとき、私は3つの特定の分野についてお話ししました。ひとつは、金融政策がアメリカの若者の将来の生活の質にどのような影響を与えるか、そしてあなたがそこで行っている仕事についてです。

もうひとつは、気候変動リスクと、私が将来的に課題となると考えている商業用不動産の状況です。住宅市場、住宅の値ごろ感、金利については、以前にも質問されたことがあると思いますが、今日はこの3つのトピックに絞ってお話しします。

ほんの少し範囲を狭めて、これらの問題や課題が、やはりアメリカの次世代の生活の質にどのような影響を与えるかについてお聞きしたいと思います。手頃な価格で購入可能な住宅が極端に不足しているため、高金利と相まって、若いアメリカ人は絶えず住宅を購入できず、賃貸市場に押しやられ、賃貸コストが上昇している。つまり、トリクルダウンの影響があるのです。



ラフォンザ・バトラー
最近の『ワシントン・ポスト』紙の分析によると、Z世代はミレニアル世代の10年前と比べ、インフレ調整後で31％多く住宅に費やしています。今日の金利と金融バランス、そしてFRBが行っている政策バランスは、今日の状況を外挿するとすれば、将来の世代の苦境にどのように寄与するとお考えですか？


ジェローム・パウエル
もちろん、私たちの仕事は経済全体であり、経済全体のためのインフレです。私たちが若い人たちのためにできる最善のことは、物価の安定を取り戻すことです。ですから、私の成人してからの人生の大半は、インフレとは無縁でした。

つまり、安定した金利、比較的低い金利ということだ。FRBの仕事は、住宅市場を経済全体から切り離して見ることではありません。とはいえ、短期的には金利の上昇が住宅購入を難しくしていることは間違いない。

しかし、長期的に見れば、これは -- 特にまだ住宅市場に出ていない若い人々にとっては -- 最良のことなのです。


ラフォンツァ・バトラー
このような地域社会、有権者、人口、そして、山火事やテキサス州のハリケーンによる影響など、気候への深刻な影響に直面している私の州の懸念に沿うような形で、FRBの試験的な気候シナリオ演習について、あなたのご意見をお聞かせください。

FRBは5月に試験的な気候シナリオ演習を実施し、米国の大手銀行6行に、大規模なハリケーンが北東部を襲った場合にバランスシートがどのような影響を受けるかを検討するよう依頼した。これらの銀行は、財産の特性、取引相手、保険の適用範囲に関するデータギャップに直面していることを報告した。連邦準備制度理事会（FRB）は、気候変動に関連した財務情報開示を実施しようとしている銀行のために、モデル化リソースの拡大にどのように投資するつもりですか？


ジェローム・パウエル
そのため、その情報をどうするか、あるいはその作業を繰り返すかどうかについては、まだ何も決定していません。ご指摘の点については、銀行がどのようにこれを考え、どのようにモデル化し、どのように機能するのかを学ぶためのものでした。モデル化するのは非常に難しいことで、それがこの演習の本質でした。

情報開示という点では、これは私たちの仕事ではありません。それは本当にSECの仕事です。気候に関する大きな仕事はしていない。しかし、私たちが規制している金融機関が、気候変動によるリスクも含めて、どのようなリスクがあるのかを認識し、理解しているかどうかを確認することです。


ラフォンザ・バトラー
 では、どのような基準で、この演習を再度実施するかどうか、あるいは演習の結果をより広く共有するかどうかを評価するのですか？


ジェローム・パウエル
その練習の結果の大部分は公表したと思う。私たちは......私たちはそれを見て、私たちは何を学んだのか、次回は何を学ぶ必要があるのかを自問しています。


ラフォンツァ・バトラー
ありがとうございます。ありがとうございます。


シェロッド・ブラウン：
ハガティ議員です。


ウィリアム・ハガティ
ありがとうございます パウエル議長、ようこそ。パウエル議長は先週ポルトガルで、利下げに踏み切る前にインフレ率が持続的に低下していることを「もっと確信したい」とおっしゃいました。また、証言では、利下げを行う前に、より大きな確信と、より良いデータが必要だとも述べています。

あなたがデータに何を求めているのか、またそこに到達するまでにどれくらいの時間がかかるのか、お聞かせいただけますか？


ジェローム・パウエル
もっと良いインフレデータを見る必要がある。それだけだ。昨年末は7ヵ月間、良好なインフレデータが続いた。その後、インフレ率が上昇した四半期があった。そして今は......本当に良いインフレが1回と、かなり良いインフレが1回です。

信頼感が高まるように、もっと見る必要がある。私は言うつもりはないが......。


ウィリアム・ハガティ
もっと？数週間先なのか、数ヵ月先なのか？言えますか？


ジェローム・パウエル：
データ次第なので、今日は時間について具体的なシグナルを出すのは避けたい。労働市場で何が起こっているかも重要だ。もし労働市場が予想外に弱くなれば、それは政策緩和のケースになりうる。

本当に、私たちはこの2つの要素を天秤にかけているのです。


ウィリアム・ハガティ
私の懸念事項のひとつです。おそらくあなたも同じだと思います。インフレ率は40年ぶりの高水準にあります。インフレ率は下がってきていますが、目標の2％には達していません。私の懸念は、言葉は悪いですが、今見ているデータから見て、これが一過性のものなのかどうかということです。


ジェローム・パウエル
それこそが、私たちが......私たちがこの問題に慎重に取り組んでいる理由です。


ウィリアム・ハガティ
それがあなたの答えだと思いました ありがとうございます。では、国債発行の話に移りましょうか。FRBは国債の最大の保有者です。2月にあなたと私は、財政赤字が金利に与える圧力についてお話ししました。

今回は、国債発行がわが国の経済と金融政策にどのような影響を与えているかについてお話ししたいと思います。まず、基本的な質問です。もし財務省の発行額がカーブのロングエンドかショートエンドのどちらかに大きくシフトしたら、金利に影響を与えるでしょうか？あるいはもっと単純に、満期をまたぐ供給量の変化は金利やイールドカーブに影響を与えるのでしょうか？


ジェローム・パウエル
理論的にはあり得ると思います。


ウィリアム・ハガティ
ええ、私もそう思います。ご存知のように、財務省借入諮問委員会は、米国債の構成比を15～20％にするよう勧告しています。しかし今、財務省はその推奨範囲を大幅に超えて国庫短期証券を発行している。私を含む一部の人々は、これは選挙を控えて市場を人為的に刺激するために行われていると考えている。

このような債務管理の操作はインフレ圧力を刺激し、納税者の負担を増やす。財務省が短期債を過剰に発行し、それが長期金利を引き下げていることを考えると、インフレを抑制するという金融政策の目標とは逆行しているのではないか？


ジェローム・パウエル
ですから、私たちは財務省の債務管理の決定を受け止めています。それについてコメントすることはない。ただ自分の仕事をするだけだ。だから、私は...


ウィリアム・ハガティ
彼らの決定についてコメントを求めているわけではありません。しかし、単純な数学的真実として、もし彼らがカーブの長い方の需要を引き下げているなら、それは...


ジェローム・パウエル
インフレに重要な影響を与えるとは言えません。


ウィリアム・ハガティ
バイデン政権が戦略石油備蓄を使い果たしたのと同じように、エネルギーショックに対応する能力が損なわれていると感じます。財務省がこのような方法で債務を管理すれば、将来の経済ショックに対応する能力が制約される。そしてそれは、FRBのバランスシート縮小の影響を増幅させたり、最も重要な短期債務商品のひとつである債券の供給量を増加させたりと、わが国を非常に現実的なリスクにさらすことになる。

国債市場の混乱につながるリスクが高まっているように思える。議長、FRBがこの事態をどのように乗り切るのか、また、この危険な動きが強まっていることについて財務省側と議論されたことがあるかどうか、お考えをお聞かせください。


ジェローム・パウエル
FRBは財務省の債務管理については関与していません。財務省がそのような決定を下すのです。また、金融政策に関しても我々の席はない。また、金融政策に関しても我々の席はない。


ウィリアム・ハガティ
しかし、このようなポートフォリオ管理で私たちがどこへ向かおうとしているのか、そのリスクは非常に明白だと思います。


ジェローム・パウエル
正直なところ、財務省の債務管理について私がコメントするのは、完全に埒外です。


ウィリアム・ハガティ
議長、あなたは非常に難しい手をつかまれたと思います。バイデン政権の政策は、選挙を前に景気を刺激することを目的としています。こうした努力は、FRBにおけるあなたの政策目標を直接的に損なうものです。その中には短期債務の過剰発行も含まれている。考えてみてほしい。フレディマックによる第二抵当権の裏付け、違法な学生ローンの内容や取り消し、燃料価格を抑制するための戦略石油備蓄の流出、そしてバイデン大統領自身によるFOMCへの金利引き下げのおどし。

ご存知のように、連邦準備制度理事会（FRB）は金融政策を政治的影響から保護するために設立された。もしFOMCが経済データではなく政治的な計算によって何らかの影響を受けるようなことがあれば、独立した機関としてのFRBの信頼性は著しく損なわれるだろう。

そうなれば市場の不確実性が増し、世界の基軸通貨としてのドルの地位も危うくなるだろう。議長、ありがとうございました。


シェロッド・ブラウン
マサチューセッツのウォーレン上院議員です。


エリザベス・ウォーレン
議長、ありがとうございます。巨大銀行の最高経営責任者（CEO）が、銀行により多くのリスクを負わせることでボーナスを増やすことができれば、彼らは銀行を経営破綻に追い込むリスクを負うことになります。それは2008年に起こったことであり、2023年にもまた起こったことである。しかし2010年、議会はドッド・フランク法を可決した。第956条は金融規制当局に対し、この問題を解決するよう指示した。

2ヵ月前、規制当局はある提案を出したが、FRBは参加を拒否した。そして2018年、FRB議長はこの委員会に対し、銀行が過度なリスクテイクのインセンティブを与えないような報酬制度を導入することを期待すると述べた。言い換えれば、あなたは銀行が自分たちでルールを作ることを信頼したのだ。

この提案のひとつは、大手銀行に対し、例えばトレーディング・デスクの責任者のように、銀行の財務を賭けることができる重要な従業員のボーナスを遅らせるよう求めるものだ。パウエル委員長、あなたが銀行に自主規制を任せると言ってから6年半の間に、大手銀行10行のうち何行が、リスクテイクによって銀行を危険にさらす可能性のある重要な従業員グループに対する年間賞与を遅らせる方針を打ち出しましたか？


ジェローム・パウエル
具体的にはわかりません。私の推測では、金融危機以降、すべての銀行がそうだと思います。


エリザベス・ウォーレン
では、あなたは......あなたは、金融崩壊や再度の救済を避けるために、銀行の自主規制を信頼せよと言った規制当局者ですね。それが実行されたかどうかはわからないのですか？


ジェローム・パウエル
まあ、あなたは......あなたが尋ねているのは、非常に、非常に特定の狭い質問なのですが......。


エリザベス・ウォーレン
それは非常に具体的なことです、なぜなら...


それは..：
それは...


エリザベス・ウォーレン：
規制当局がすべきことです。あなたは答えが十中八九だと考えている。答えは10中0だ


ジェローム・パウエル：
それはどうでしょう？


エリザベス・ウォーレン：
この件に関する彼らの声明を見てみましょう。この規則案はもうひとつ、銀行の安定性を脅かすようなリスクを取った役員に対するボーナスや賞与の支給を全面的に禁止することを検討するよう銀行に求めています。では、パウエル議長にお聞きします。あなたが「銀行の自主規制を信頼する」と述べてから6年半、大手10行のうち何行が、不適切なリスクテイクを行った経営幹部に対するボーナスを全面的に拒否するよう求める方針を持つようになったのでしょうか？


ジェローム・パウエル
その答えはわかりません。ところで、私は銀行が自ら規制することを信用しろとは言っていない。


エリザベス・ウォーレン
ごめんなさい. もう一度正確に引用しましょうか？


ジェローム・パウエル：
銀行の自主規制を信じろと？


エリザベス・ウォーレン：
"銀行が過度なリスクを取らないような" "報酬制度を導入することを期待します


ジェローム・パウエル：
そうですね、...


エリザベス・ウォーレン
それは...


ジェローム・パウエル：
2010年に発行したガイダンスによると、かなり詳細です。


エリザベス・ウォーレン
エリザベス・ウォーレン：あなたが委員長に就任して以来、ガイダンスは発行していませんね。また、あなたがおっしゃったような規制を実際に導入した銀行はどのくらいあるのでしょうか？答えは、10行中...


ジェローム・パウエル
それは...


エリザベス・ウォーレン：
ゼロです


ゼロだ
2010年のガイダンス


エリザベス・ウォーレン
いや、あなたは2018年にこれらを導入すると言った。


ジェローム・パウエル：
私は、これを導入すると言ったのです。


エリザベス・ウォーレン
いいえ、それはあなたが言ったことではありません。つまり、パウエル議長、あなたがおっしゃるように、この問題に関する最後のガイダンスは2010年で、あなたがFRBにいる前です。FRBは現在、議会が指示した通り、他の金融規制当局とともに956条を実施する規則を確定することを拒否している。そこで私が疑問に思っているのは、大手銀行10行のうち何行がこれを実施したのかということだ。

ドッド・フランク法は14年前に成立した。銀行が経営陣の危険な行動に報いるのを止めるルールはまだない。今年3月、あなたは956条の規則について質問され、「規則を提案する前に、私たちが解決しようとしている問題を理解したい」と答えました。

パウエル議長、法律は、ジェローム・パウエルがその無限の知恵で、役員報酬に問題があるかどうかを決めるべきだとは言っていません。14年前に成立した法律では、役員報酬は経済の安定を脅かす問題であり、それを抑制するためのルールを作れ、と言っているのです。ようやく、ようやく、他の金融規制当局がそのようなルールを提案しましたが、FRBは参加していません。

パウエル議長、国内10大銀行があなたのアプローチを好む理由は理解できます。やりたい放題にさせるのだから。しかし、あなたは巨大銀行のために働いているのではない。あなたはアメリカ国民のために働いているのです。自分の仕事を全うしてほしい。ありがとうございました


シェロッド・ブラウン
オハイオのバンス上院議員です


J.D.バンスです
ありがとうございます 議長 パウエル議長、お集まりいただきありがとうございます。先週は私どもの事務所にお越しいただき、この問題について議論していただき、ありがとうございました。それは、移民問題、特にバイデン政権下の極めて高い不法移民レベルとインフレ問題の持続との関係です。

しかし、あなたは連邦準備制度理事会（FRB）の議長なのですから、あなたの見解をお聞きしたいのです。特に、あなたのガバナーの一人であるミッキー・ボウマンの言葉を引用したいと思います。移民の増加と労働市場の逼迫が続けば、コア・サービス・インフレが高止まりするリスクがある。

現在、手頃な価格の住宅在庫が少ないことを考えると、地域によっては新たな移民の流入により、住宅供給が増えるまでに時間がかかり、家賃の上昇圧力につながる可能性がある。労働市場がタイトなままであるため、賃金上昇率は4％前後またはそれ以上に高まっており、生産性のトレンド的な伸びを考慮すると、インフレ目標2％と一致するペースよりもまだ高い。

イングランド銀行は最近、英国のこの問題に関する報告書を作成したと思いますが、明らかに経済も国も異なります。ハガティ議員がおっしゃったように、過去40年間で最も高いインフレ率をここ数年記録していますが、特に住宅がその大きな原動力となっていることを考えると、この関係をどうお考えでしょうか。

不法移民が住宅費の高騰にどのような役割を果たしているとお考えですか？


ジェローム・パウエル
移民政策についてはコメントしませんが、インフレについてはコメントします。


J.D.バンス
そうです。


ジェローム・パウエル：
だから、こう言いたい。ここ2、3年の間に、多くの人が亡命希望で入国し、働きに出ました。労働力の供給は大幅に増加した。それは......明確な答えはありませんが、私の感覚では......長期的に見れば、移民はインフレに対して中立のようなものです。

短期的には、人が増えたことで労働市場が緩んだので、実際には助けになったかもしれない。しかし、あなたは具体的に住宅について話している。新しい人が入ってきて、それがすでに逼迫している住宅市場に寄与しているような場所が、国内にはあるはずです。

しかし、全体的なインフレ率から見れば、それが一方的な要因だとは言えないでしょう。


J.D.バンス：
ブラウン委員長、このスレッドの続きですが、影響を受けた特定の地域ということで。ブラウン委員長、全会一致の同意を得て、州南西部の州境、スプリングフィールド市からの書簡を提出したいと思います。

スプリングフィールドでは、移民による人口急増が見られ、地域社会としてすべての人に十分な住宅機会を提供する能力に大きな影響を与えています。スプリングフィールドのハイチ人人口は、過去4年間で1万5千人から2万人増加し、6万人弱の住民しかいなかったこのコミュニティは、すべての住民に十分な住宅を提供する資源と能力に大きな負担をかけています。

そして私の...


シェロッド・ブラウン：
異議なし、命令する。


J.D.バンスです：
ありがとうございます。スプリングフィールドの人たちと話をすると、住宅だけではありません。人口5万5,000人の町に新たに5,000戸の住宅を建設するのは至難の業です。しかし、それは病院サービスでもある。学校サービスもある。この移民問題は、人間にとって非常に現実的な結果をもたらしていると思います。

パウエル委員長、この移民と労働供給の問題について、もうひとつだけ質問させてください。経済学者が労働供給と移民について語るとき、婉曲的な言い方をすることがあります。

そして彼らが事実上言っているのは、移民の増加がアメリカ人労働者の賃金に下落圧力をかけているということだ。あなたの同僚やFRB以外のエコノミストたちが、移民の増加やそれが賃金を押し下げる要因になっていることについて話しているのを聞くと、なるほど、それはインフレを押し下げる要因になっているのは明らかだが、家族のために働く人々の賃金を押し下げる要因にもなっている。

なぜ私たちはそれを良いことだと考えるのでしょうか？あるいは、それが間違っているのかもしれない。その前提が根本的に間違っているのかもしれない。しかし、なぜ多くの経済学者が新しい労働力の流入を良いこととして扱うのだろうか？労働力が制約され、労働供給が制約されるのであれば、アメリカの労働者の賃金上昇につながるのではないだろうか？


ジェローム・パウエル
だから、私たちは......私は......私は......確かに価値判断を下そうとはしていない。


J.D.バンス
フェアだ


そうですね：
しかし、私が言いたいのは、これはすべて労働市場が非常に逼迫していた中で、ここ2、3年の間に起こったことだということです。現在では少し逼迫しているが、かなり逼迫している。しかし、労働者不足があり、求人中の企業もある。失業者1人につき1つ以上の求人がある。

つまり、労働市場は非常に逼迫しており、それに対処しているのです。賃金上昇はまだ非常に高いですが、より持続可能なレベルまで下がってきています。


J.D.バンス
そうですね。議長、時間がオーバーしているのは承知しています。もう1つだけ質問させてください。ありがとうございます。パウエル議長のご指摘は理解できます。繰り返しになりますが、私はあなたに価値判断を下しているわけではありません。しかし、もし労働市場が本当に逼迫していて、労働者1人当たりの求人数が1件を超えているとしたら、それを解決する方法はもっともらしく2つあります。

ひとつは、移民制度を通じて労働者を新たに流入させる方法。もうひとつは、賃金を引き上げ、副業として働いている労働者を呼び込む方法だ。具体的には、労働力から脱落した700万人の働き盛りの男性について考えている。労働力不足が叫ばれているのに、なぜ政策立案者は労働力不足に焦点を当てないのでしょうか？

新しい移民を大量に受け入れるよりも、労働者の何人かを副業から解放するような方法で賃金を上げようとしないのだろうか？私の目から見ると、その方がずっといいように思える。


ジェローム・パウエル
確かに、それは非常に建設的な焦点だ。私もそう思う。どちらか一方でなければならないということはないと思います。


J.D.バンス
ありがとうございました。


シェロッド・ブラウン：
メリーランド州選出のヴァン・ホーレン上院議員です。


クリス・ヴァン・ホーレン
ありがとうございます パウエル議長、お会いできて光栄です。パウエル議長、お目にかかれて光栄です。少なくともこれまでのところ、失業率の急上昇や大幅な上昇を引き起こすことなく、インフレ率低下の軌道に乗っているあなたとFRBのチームに、まず拍手を送りたいと思います。しかし、FRBがその危険性を十分に認識した上で行動しなければ、それがリスクになることはよくご存知でしょう。

あなたが3月にここにいらっしゃったとき、利下げを長く待ちすぎることによる失業率へのリスクを「よく承知している」、「それを避けることを強く意識している」とおっしゃいました。それ以来、景気は減速し、失業率は上昇している。KPMGのチーフ・エコノミスト、ダイアン・スウォンクの分析によると、「氷は薄くなっている。

アメリカ経済に赤信号が灯りつつある。経済のエンジンである労働市場の冷え込みは、これまで知られていたよりも早い。失業率は2021年以来初めて4％を超えた。失業率は2021年以来初めて4％を超えた。経済成長の3分の2を占めるサービス部門の経済活動は6月に減速した。

そこで質問ですが、議長、これらすべての要因をどのように考慮されますか？今日現在、あなたのレーダー・スクリーンに映っている以上に失業率が上昇する現実的なリスクがあるという私の懸念を、あなたは共有していますか？


ジェローム・パウエル
そうですね、私たちは......私たちは......私は......私たちがここにいた3月よりもさらに、そう見ています。労働市場の状況は2年前と比べてかなり冷え込んでいる。この2、3回の測定までは、このようなことは言いませんでした。

また、長い間、インフレ目標を達成できないリスクの方が大きかった。しかし、物価の安定と最大限の雇用という2つの法定目標に対するリスクは、かなりバランスが取れてきていると思います。私たちは、この2つのリスクを管理する方法で、連邦資金金利を管理し、その使途を決定するというプロセスを管理しなければならないことを十分に理解しています。

そして、この2つの義務は法の下では同等です。ですから、私たちはそれを理解しています。


クリス・ヴァン・ホーレン
ありがとうございます。というのも、失業率の上昇を抑えるのに十分な行動をすぐに取らなかったために、今、私たちがリスクを抱えていることをデータが示しているからです。

 また、すでに言われているように、住宅セクターでは高金利が足を引っ張り続けている。

今日お聞きになったように、私たちの同僚は皆、当然のことながら、住宅価格の高騰について有権者から聞かされていると思います。また、製造業など他の分野への投資も鈍化しています。というのも、ウォーレン議員が質問したドッド・フランク法第956条の実施について、私はあなたの同僚のバー副議長に質問しました。

そして私は、なぜFRBが他の機関とともに、この法律と10年来の法律の実施に関して前進しなかったのかについて質問した。NCUAは規則を提案する意向を示している。SECは前進する意向を示している。私はバー副議長に、FRBから規則案の通達が出ていないが、FRBが規則案の通達を出すことで、この法律の施行プロセスを速やかに開始することを確約してもらえないか、と申し上げた。

彼の答えは、私の同僚と議論する中で、理事会としては、どのような措置を講じるか決定する前に、さらに分析を行う必要があると考えていることが明らかになった、というものだった。我々は956条を実施するために法律に従うことを約束するが、さらにやるべきことがある。この法律が成立してから10年が経とうとしていることに、非常にフラストレーションを感じている者の一人です。

バー副議長、法律に従うことを約束します。議長、あなたは法に従うことを約束されるでしょう。しかし、FRBが956の実施を進めるのにこれほど時間がかかるのはなぜですか？


ジェローム・パウエル
私はこの法律の実際の文言に注目するのが好きなのですが、その文言によると、過剰なリスクテイクを引き起こす特定のインセンティブ報酬慣行について、規制当局に判断を下すよう求めています。そして私たちはそれを行っていない。私たちは、2010年にかなり本格的なガイダンスを作成し、コメントを募集しました。

私たちはこれらの疑問点をすべて検討しました。それは14年間続いている。我々はそれを監督している。世界的な金融危機の前に起きていたことではなく、今起きていることを調べてみよう。

大企業に限って言えば、概ねうまくいっているようだ。そして、15年前のものをそのまま持ち出すのではなく、残存リスクに対応したものを設計しようということです。それで、現在FRBではそのようなことに取り組んでいます。繰り返しになりますが、法律では、そうしたことを禁止するための規制やガイドラインを定めることを求めています。

私はそうしたいと思っています。ある意味、私たちはそうしてきたのです。


クリス・ヴァン・ホーレン
では、ごく簡単にですが、FRBはすでにその要件を満たしているというのがあなたの証言ですか？


ジェローム・パウエル
いいえ。


いいえ：
そうですか


ジェローム・パウエル：いいえ：
いいえ


クリス・ヴァン・ホーレン：
ただ、それを明確にしておきたい。FRBが前進することを期待しています。ありがとうございました。


シェロッド・ブラウン：
ヴァン・ホーレン議員、ありがとうございました。アラバマ州のブリット上院議員です。


ケイティ・ブリット
ありがとうございます パウエル議長、本日はありがとうございます。メリーランド州選出の私の同僚が、あることに触れていました。マサチューセッツの同僚の話を聞いていて、特にドッド・フランク法と956法についてですが、最後に巨大銀行のために働いているのか、それともアメリカ国民のために働いているのか、というコメントがありました。

私はあなたに話したい長い質問のリストがありますが、私はあなたにそれについて答えてもらいたかったのです。


ジェローム・パウエル：
ええ、それはまったく事実ではありません。私たちがやっていることは、国際的な義務に沿ったものであり、アメリカ経済にとって最善のものです。それが私たちの唯一の考えです。さまざまな点で政策の違いはありますが、私たちは皆、奉仕する人々のために最善の結果を出そうとしているのです。


ケイティ・ブリット：
その通りです。ありがとうございます。パウエル委員長、私はこれまで何度も長期債務提案に対する懸念について話してきましたが、よく考えられていないと思います。まず、テーラーメイドの要件をあからさまに損ねることに懸念があります。その点、2155は長期債務要件に適用されるとお考えですか？


ジェローム・パウエル
すべてに適用されると思います。


KATIE BRITT：
もちろんです。


もちろんです：
そして、長期債務要件については、膨大な量のコメントがあり、私たちはそれを注意深く見て、どうするかというプロセスを考えているところです。


ケイティ・ブリット
いや、それはありがたい。なぜなら、現在のところ、本当の意味での費用対効果の分析が欠けていると思うからだ。さらに、バーゼルIIIと重複する性質を考慮すると、バーゼルIIIが銀行や金融機関の自己資本規制にとってどのような意味を持つのかさえ理解できていないのに、その規則を最終化する新たな長期債務案を進めるのは不適切だと思います。

そこで質問です。バーゼルIIIが最終化される前に、長期債務案を最終化することは不適切でしょうか？




ジェローム・パウエル
明確なお答えはできません。それ次第でしょう。バーゼルIIIが最終的に決定されるのは当分先のことでしょうが、私たちがやろうとしていることを人々が理解し、受け入れ、支持するところに到達しないとは言い切れません。しかし、私たちがやっていることを人々が理解し、受け入れ、支持するようにならないとは言い切れません。


ケイティ・ブリット
あなたが他の同僚に、これが実施されるのは来年の初めだろうと話していたのを聞きました。私が懸念しているのは、FRBは長期債務ルールがバーゼル最終案に直接影響されると言っていることです。ですから、銀行がバーゼルで直面することを十分に理解する前に、長期債務規制を進めることがなぜ不適切あるいは適切なのでしょうか。

その点については、熟慮をお願いしたい。バーゼル規制は、多くの銀行が直面し、その意味を理解しようとしているものです。そして、私たちが一貫して見てきたのは、人々がこれらのことの累積的な影響に目を向けず、トリクルダウン効果に目を向けていないということです。

バーゼルに関しては、3月の証言で、FRBは商品市場への潜在的な影響を認識し、十分に検討しているとおっしゃいました。商品市場、つまり農業はアラバマ州の雇用の5人に1人、経済の20％を占めています。

私は食料安全保障は国家安全保障であると信じていますが、この提案はヘッジ・コストを80％増加させるでしょう。つまり、銀行が清算サービスを提供する可能性が低くなり、またその気も失せるということだ。その結果、農業界に悪影響を及ぼし、食料と繊維を供給する他のコストが増加する可能性がある。

飼料、種子、肥料などの投入資材の価格が高騰し、その価格が消費者に転嫁されている。食料品の価格は1月以来21％上昇しています。では、今回のバーゼル改正案によって、農家や農業関係者がバーゼルIIIに対して抱いていた懸念は解消されるとお考えですか？また、FRBはこれを検討するために何か特別なことを行ったのでしょうか？

もしそうでないなら、そうすることを約束しますか？


ジェローム・パウエル
具体的な変更点については触れたくない。ただ、私たちはこの一連の変更についてよく承知しており、非常に集中していること、そして、あなたが提起した問題に細心の注意を払っていることだけは申し上げておきます。


ケイティ・ブリット
また、FRBがこの種の規制を策定する際には、経済への影響とコミュニティ・バンクが地域社会にサービスを提供する能力との関係を本当に考慮してほしいと思います。FRBがこのような規制を策定する際には、経済への影響とコミュニティ・バンクが地域社会に貢献する能力との関係を本当によく考慮していただきたい。

最後の数秒で、もうひとつトピックに触れたいと思います。手ごろな価格のチャイルドケアを拡大するための解決策を見つけることは、私の最優先事項です。そこでパウエル委員長、手頃な価格の保育へのアクセスを増やすことは、わが国の労働参加にプラスの影響を与えるとお考えですか？


ジェローム・パウエル
そう思います。


ケイティ・ブリット：
ありがとうございます。


シェロッド・ブラウン：
[ネバダ州のマストです


キャサリン・コルテス・マスト：
ありがとう ありがとうございます。パウエル委員長、ご出席いただきありがとうございます。冒頭のコメントから始めさせてください。過去2年間、経済は連邦準備制度理事会（FRB）の2％のインフレ目標に向けてかなり前進したとおっしゃいました。

労働市場の状況は冷え込んでいますが、力強さは維持しています。こうした動きを反映して、雇用とインフレの目標達成に向けたリスクは、より良いバランスになりつつあります。バイデン大統領の就任以来、米国は1500万人以上の雇用を増やした。バイデン大統領の下で、私たちは41ヵ月連続で雇用を増加させ、賃金も上昇している。

2021年1月から2024年4月までの間に、米国の平均賃金と給与は16,700ドル近く増加しました。では、今日先ほどのランキング・メンバーの「米国は地球上で最も偉大な経済大国である」という発言に同意されますか？


ジェローム・パウエル
そうですね。


キャサリン・コルテス・マストです：
FRBの独立性、そしてFRBの独立性がどれほど重要かについて、今日、話がありました。ウォール・ストリート・ジャーナル紙は最近、トランプ前政権当局者が、11月にトランプ大統領が当選した場合、連邦準備制度理事会（FRB）の独立性を弱めるための政策オプションを起草したと報じた。

伝えられるところによると、元政権高官はFRBの独立性を損ない、大統領が金利決定に影響を与えたり、FRB議長を自由に解雇したりしやすくするための政策オプションについて議論していたという。パウエル議長、FRBが経済の安定を提供し、インフレ期待を安定させるために独立性を保つことがどれほど重要ですか？


ジェローム・パウエル
私は、FRBの独立性は必要不可欠だと思います。そして良いニュースは、それがかなり広く理解されているということです。私たちは可能な限り政治的プロセスの外で仕事をする必要があるということを、人々は理解していると思います。

もちろん、私たちは説明責任を果たし、透明性を確保する必要があります。金融政策報告書の中央銀行の独立性に関する欄を見ると、まさに透明性に関する欄になっています。これはその裏返しです。ですから、これは本当に重要なことだと思います。この制度は国民によく役立っていると思います。

そして、私は、この制度には幅広い支持があると信じています。


キャサリン・コルテス・マスト
あなたは今、まさにこのような理由から、長年にわたって意図的に制度的な取り決めをしてきたとおっしゃいましたね？


ジェローム・パウエル：
そしてその結果は明らかで、独立した中央銀行を持つことで、インフレ期待がより安定し、インフレ率や経済全般のパフォーマンスが向上しているのです。

しかし、ショックや危機がないとは言い切れない。


キャサリン・コルテス・マスト
ネバダ州では、移民の受け入れが進んでいます。ネバダ州では、移民は経済にとって非常に重要です。医師、看護師、教師など、私のコミュニティにとって必要不可欠な労働者です。あなたの仕事に影響を与えない他の付随的な問題には立ち入らずに、移民が雇用率にどのような影響を与えるのか、またなぜ移民問題に注目するのか、どのような理由で移民問題に注目するのか、詳しく話していただけますか？


ジェローム・パウエル
ですから、私たちは......繰り返しになりますが、私たちは......あなたのおっしゃるとおり、私たちは移民政策について立場をとらず、コメントもしません。私たちには何の責任もない。それは私たちの仕事ではありません。ただ、私たちは数字を見て、移民の経済的な影響を評価しようとしているだけです。

この2年間、私たちは......私たちは......2年前、私たちは本当に労働力不足の経済状況にありました。そして何が起こったかというと、移民の波が押し寄せてきて、その人たちの多くが亡命手続きを経て合法的に働くようになったのです。

また、合法的な手続きを経ていないグループもありますが、この最新のグループの多くは、庇護を求め、労働許可証を取得する手続きを経ています。つまり、雇用主は労働者を求めていて、現在では、積極的に仕事を探している人や働いている人の数よりも、求人の数のほうが多いのです。

そして今、新たな労働者が供給され、その雇用を満たした。だから経済規模は大きくなったが、経済が逼迫しているわけではない。これは単なる算数であり、良いことでも悪いことでもない。他の政策選択もあり得るが、それは私たちが決めることではない。


キャサリン・コルテス・マスト
より大きな...より大きな経済...


ジェローム・パウエル：
より大きな経済。


キャサリン・コルテス・マスト：
つまり、経済の成長を向上させたということですか？


ジェローム・パウエル：
昨年の経済成長率は3.4％だったと思います。その一部は、議会予算局の分析が示すように、そして多くの人が驚いたことに、国内に流入した労働者のうち、数え切れないほど多くの人々が仕事に就いたからです。そして......これが、インフレ率が大幅に低下する中で経済があれほど成長できた理由の一部である。

インフレ率は2023年の間に2ポイント低下し、経済成長率は3.4％だった。つまり、2023年の経済成長率が3.4％であったにもかかわらず、インフレ率は2ポイントも低下したのです。


キャサリン・コルテス・マスト
ありがとうございます。


シェロッド・ブラウン：
ノースダコタのクレイマー上院議員です。


ケビン・クレイマー：
どうも、議長 ありがとうございます。いつもながら、最後の質問で私の予習はすべて水の泡です。合法移民の労働力についてですが、これはあなたの専門分野ではないことは承知していますが、労働力の問題は経済にとって重要です。毎年100万人以上の人々を合法的に受け入れていますが、その大半は仕事もスキルセットも持っていません。他のどの国でも、経済的に有用な何らかの技能セットが必要です。

私たちはそのようなことをあまりしていません。以上、私のスピーチを終わります。バーゼルIIIについては、すでに多くの具体的な質問が寄せられています。ノースダコタ州の大規模な発電・送電事業者である農村電気協同組合（Rural Electric Cooperatives）は電気事業を基盤としており、アッパーミッドウェスト全域に非常に大規模なG&Tメンバーを有しています。

その例を挙げたい。私たちが話しているのは電力供給についてです。信頼性を維持することは非常に重要だ。手頃な価格を維持することも重要です。電力協同組合のリスク管理プログラムの一環として、発電燃料（この場合は天然ガス）の購入方法があります。

天然ガスは上下動が激しく、時には大きく変動する商品のひとつですが、発電所向けの固定価格で購入することでヘッジすることができます。電力価格は一般的にスポット価格に追随しますから。

スポット価格が高騰すれば電気料金も高騰する。しかし、天然ガスのヘッジがあれば、協同組合はより低い固定燃料費で発電することができ、自社とその消費者を価格高騰から守ることができる。これは、協同組合とその銀行とのバランスシート上の先行コストですが、電力の信頼性と手頃な供給を守ることになります。

このような具体的な例を挙げましたが、協同組合というモデル自体にユニークな特質があることは言うまでもありません。それについてコメントしたいのであれば、あなたはすでに変更する必要があると述べています。私はそれをあなたの......あなたが考えるべきことの箱の中に投げ入れただけです。


ジェローム・パウエル
その問題については十分承知している。


ケビン・クレイマー：
ありがとうございます。それでは、私はこの独立問題についてお話ししたいと思います。質問された議員の方々のおっしゃる通りだと思います。FRBの独立性が不可欠であることはご承知の通りです。私はFRBの独立性を変えようとする党内の動きに抵抗してきたが、そのような動きは非常に狭く、あまり現実的ではないと思う。

少なくとも国会議事堂では、その点ではほぼ一致しているというご指摘はありがたい。認識は重要です。パンデミックを乗り切り、経済を維持するために必要な支出をするよう、あなたは議会として私たちに強く諭した。

それは正しかったと思う。民主党がインフレ抑制法とアメリカン・レスキュー・プランを前面に押し出して、基本的に経済を乗っ取り、インフレに拍車をかけたと思います。

しかし、認識は重要です。ですから、私はあなたに申し上げておきたいのですが、あなたはこれを実行するとは言っていませんし、あなたがこれを実行すると信じる根拠もありません。

しかし、あなたが独立を保つ限り、私はあなたの味方です。中立的な立場がいいと思う。ところで、あなたは退屈であることが最も崇高なことのひとつであるような仕事をしている。だから素晴らしい仕事だ。ありがとう。


ジェローム・パウエル
ありがとう 最善を尽くします。


ありがとう
ありがとうございます ウォーノック上院議員をお招きします。[笑]


ラファエル・ワーノック：
そうですね 議長、どうもありがとうございました。最新の金融政策報告書によると、住宅費のインフレは徐々に緩和している。これは良いニュースです。しかし、多くのジョージア州民は、手の届かない住宅や住宅ローンに苦しんでいます。その理由のひとつは、住宅建設が十分でないことだ。

2022年にJournal of Economic Geography誌に発表された研究によると、住宅ストックが10％増加するごとに、家賃は1％減少した。我々はこの問題、特に住宅供給が住宅コストに及ぼす影響について議論してきた。そして、連邦準備制度理事会（FRB）は住宅供給をコントロールすることはできないが、新しい住宅、特に手頃な価格の住宅の建設を促進する環境作りを支援することはできる、ということで合意した。

パウエル議長、FRBは住宅建設を促進する環境づくりにどのように取り組んできましたか？また、残された課題は何だとお考えですか？


ジェローム・パウエル
長期的に見れば、住宅市場にとっても経済にとっても、私たちにできる最善のことは、インフレを持続的に低下させ、人々がインフレのことを話題にしなくなるようにすることです。インフレ率が2％程度になることは日常生活で誰もが想定していることであり、インフレ率について語る必要はない。

そこまで戻したい。そうすれば金利も下がり、住宅市場もパンデミック前の状態に戻ることができる。十分な住宅がないのだから、金融政策の問題ではない。しかし、短期的には、金融引き締め政策が住宅市場に重くのしかかっている。

金融政策は金利に敏感な支出を通じて機能します。そして住宅は間違いなく、金利に敏感な支出の筆頭に挙げられる。ですから、私たちは、金利を抑制しているのであって、抑制しているわけではないのですが、金利の上昇が住宅着工件数の減少や住宅市場の活性低下を招いていることは理解しています。

しかし、それは経済全体のインフレ率を2％に戻すためであり、住宅市場をより良い基盤にするためなのです。


ラファエル・ウォーノック
そうですね、それに関連して、高金利が続くと、もちろん全米で見られますが、特にジョージア州のような州では、こうした機関投資家が参入してきて、住宅を全額現金で購入し、初めて住宅を購入する第一世代の住宅購入者を囲い込んでいます。

もちろん、金利が上昇したことで、彼らにとって有利な条件が整った。その評価に同意しますか？


ジェローム・パウエル
そうですね。金利が上昇したからといって、それが......つまり、そのうちのいくつかは......彼らは......協力している


ラファエル・ウォーノック
もし金利が上昇し、現金で購入できる機関投資家がいるのなら、それは......。


ジェローム・パウエル
しかし、彼らは高い金利でお金を借りなければならない。ただ、金利が高くなったからといって、彼らの......彼らの投資が安くなるわけではないと申し上げているのです。とはいえ、これが微妙な問題であることは理解している。ほとんどの市場において、住宅ストックに占める割合はまだかなり小さい。

しかし、それは問題ではなく、我々にとっては問題ではないのです。彼らは合法的に住宅を購入している。私たちの仕事は経済全体です。つまり、それは議会の問題なのです。


ラファエル・ワーノック
では、どうすれば、どうすれば、FRBは金融ツールをより適切に投入して、住宅供給能力のような主要なインフレ目標を確実に達成することができるのでしょうか？


ジェローム・パウエル
FRBにできる最善のことは、政策緩和を考えながら慎重に行動することだと思います。そして、インフレ率が持続的に1％台まで低下していくという確信が得られたときに、それを実行するようにすることです。

また、労働市場にも注視しています。労働市場に予想外の弱さが見られれば、それにも対応する可能性があります。しかし、それこそが経済全体にとって、そして特に住宅市場にとっても最善の策なのです。


ラファエル・ウォーノック
ええ、あなたは......そして、あなたの影響力には限界があることをよく指摘していますね。私がこの委員会で、同僚のバトラー上院議員とともにダウンペイメント法案を提出したかった理由のひとつは、この法案にあります。この法案は、第一世代の住宅購入者がウォール街の機関投資家と競争できるよう、頭金や決算費用、金利引き下げ費用を援助するものである。

皆さんと生産的な対話を続け、すべてのアメリカ人にとって住宅をより買いやすいものにする方法を検討することを楽しみにしています。もう時間がないのですが、人種間の貧富の格差の是正に関して、もうひとつ懸念していることがあります。

FRBは「不動産鑑定と評価の公平性に関する省庁間タスクフォース」の一員です。FRBはこのタスクフォースにどのような専門知識と視点を提供しているのでしょうか。また、この住宅鑑定の問題にどのように対応していますか？


ジェローム・パウエル
ご存知のように、私たちはタスクフォースに積極的に参加しています。私たちは、住宅市場に関する専門知識だけでなく、一般的な規制監督や経済に関する専門知識も持ち合わせています。また、私たちが強く抱いている考えとして、銀行システムには差別は存在しないということです。

これには鑑定やその他の評価も含まれます。


ラファエル・ワーノック
それは同感です。早速ですが、CFPBとその他の機関が最近、自動化された住宅評価に関する強力な差別撤廃基準を設ける規則を最終決定したことは喜ばしいことです。FRBはまだこの規則を承認していません。なぜですか？また、FRBは承認する予定なのでしょうか？


ジェローム・パウエル
なぜですか？


ラファエル・ワーノック
CFPBが提案したルールはまだ承認されていません。彼らは規則を最終決定した。


ジェローム・パウエル
しかし、私たちは......すみません......私は......知らなかったのですが......私たちも最終化しなければならない規則だということを知りませんでした。そうなのですか？


ラファエル・ワーノック
そうだと思います。


ジェローム・パウエル
私は......それについてフォローアップさせてください。私は......私はそのことを知りません。


ラファエル・ワーノック
わかりました。ありがとうございます。


ジェローム・パウエル：
ありがとう


シェロッド・ブラウン：
モンタナ州選出の デイネス上院議員です


スティーブ・デインズ：
議長 ありがとうございます パウエル議長、本日はありがとうございます。選挙シーズン真っ只中です。選挙シーズン真っ只中です。これから選挙の日まで、バイデン-ハリス政権と同様に、民主党の同僚議員たちも、アメリカ国民に対して、財政的・経済的に4年前よりも豊かになったというおとぎ話を売り込もうと時間を無駄にすることはないだろう。

バイデン大統領が就任した当時、インフレ率は1.4％だった。彼の失敗した政策によって、過去40年間で最高のインフレ率になった。モンタナの故郷の人々は騙されていない。なぜなら、彼らの生活のいたるところで、インフレは仮定の話ではないからだ。バイデン政権の政策と議会民主党の推進によってもたらされたこの10年間の高インフレの影響を、彼らは日常的に目の当たりにしている。

経済全体のほとんどの商品やサービスのコストは、2020年よりも高くなっている。そしてそれは、どんなに政治的スピンや精神的な体操をしても消し去ることのできない事実である。いくつか例を挙げよう。朝食用シリアルは、2020年1月から28％値上がりした。ガソリン価格は全国平均で1ガロン2.63ドルから36％上昇し、3.58ドル--。

卵の価格。卵の価格は、2020年2月の1.45ドルから、2024年には2倍の1ダースあたり3ドルに跳ね上がった。この不誠実さはインフレだけにとどまらない。労働市場については、バイデン大統領と上院民主党は、先月の新規雇用者数が20万6,000人に達したという最近の雇用統計を受けて勝利の祝杯をあげているが、雇用増加の3分の1以上が政府部門によるものであるという事実を故意に無視している。

議長、私は、インフレ抑制のためにこれまであなたがしてきたことを賞賛します。そして、政治的圧力に直面する可能性があるにもかかわらず、この戦いを続けることを奨励する。また、今月初め、米国が財政不均衡に対処する切実な必要性を指摘されたことにも勇気づけられた。

これほど同意できることはない。ワシントンの無謀な支出や過剰な借金の文化は、将来の世代に借金の山を残すという非常に危険な道に私たちを導いていると、私は何度も言ってきたし、そう信じ続けている。そして、あなたがその評価に同意してくれることをうれしく思う。議長、今年は選挙の年であり、金利引き下げを求める政治的圧力に直面していることは間違いないでしょう。

これまでのところ、インフレと闘うために自由に使えるツールを使って、あなたは立派な仕事をしてきた。そして私は、カレンダーや政治的影響力ではなく、データに導かれ続けることを強く望む。あなたは先週、「物事は正しい方向に傾いているが、利下げを行う前にさらなる証拠を見る必要がある」と述べた。

そこで質問です。次回のFOMCに向けて、具体的に何に注目し、何を見据えていますか？また、最近の労働データ、特に政府雇用の重要な部分をどのように織り込んでいますか？


ジェローム・パウエル
私たちは2つのことを期待しています。ひとつは良好なインフレ・データです。昨年の最後の7ヵ月間は、かなり良好なインフレ・データが続きました。そして現在、良好なインフレデータと非常に良好なインフレデータが1つずつ出ている。インフレ率が2%に戻りつつあると確信するためには、もっと良いデータが必要だ。

インフレ率が2％になる必要はない。今は2.6％です。労働市場のインフレ率についてですが、ご質問の件では、労働市場は多くの指標でかなり冷え込んでいます。今日ここにいらっしゃる多くの方からご指摘がありましたが。

失業率は上昇しました。労働市場は現在ほぼ均衡しており、2019年にはほぼ均衡していた。今は経済にとって広範なインフレ圧力の要因にはなっていませんが、労働市場が強いことに変わりはありません。失業率4.1%は歴史的に見ても非常に低い水準です。

ですから私たちは、最大限の雇用を支援することを使命としています。また、私たちは細心の注意を払っています。もし労働市場が予想外に弱体化するようなことがあれば、つまり、重大な形でこれまで見てきた以上に弱体化するようなことがあれば、予期せぬ形で対応することもできます。

なぜなら、私たちには2つの使命があるからです。年前はインフレに焦点を当てなければならなかった。今は両方の目標に焦点を当てる必要があります。


スティーブ・ダインズ
会長、ありがとうございました。バーゼルIIIについて1つ質問させてください。3月に当委員会は、バーゼルIIIには重大な欠陥があり、全面的に書き直す必要があるとの見解で一致しました。先月、連邦準備制度理事会（FRB）が他の金融規制に対して、バーゼルⅢの変更案を提示したとの報道を目にし、勇気づけられました。

しかし、どのような変更を加える予定なのか、また、現在進行中の更新案の作成状況を教えてください。


ジェローム・パウエル
バー監督担当副委員長を中心に、FDICおよびOCCと広範な話し合いを行ってきました。私たちは、一連の変更案について合意に近い形で多くの進展を遂げました。残された課題は、今後のプロセスについて合意することです。私たちの組織的な見解としては、ある程度の期間、コメントを求めるために変更案を公表し、コメントを求めるすべての一般市民がその変更案をもう一度見て、コメントし、私たちが行った定量的影響度調査との関連性を確認できるようにする必要があると考えています。

それが正しい進め方です。通常であれば、そのように進める。それを逸脱する理由はない。そして、これがFDICとOCCの指導部との話し合いです。そして私が望むのは、私たちが前進するための方法について、すぐにまとまることができるということだ。

今までにそうなることを期待していましたが、かなり近いうちにそうなると思います。


スティーブ・ダインズ
ありがとうございます


シェロッド・ブラウン：
パウエル議長、本日はありがとうございます。パウエル議長、本日はありがとうございました。公聴会の記録用に質問を提出したい議員の方は、本日7月16日から1週間以内に提出してください。パウエル議長におかれましては、質問に対する回答を45日以内に提出してください。

証言ありがとうございました。委員会は閉会します。
